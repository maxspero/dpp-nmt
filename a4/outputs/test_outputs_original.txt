You know what I do is to write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, and, in fact, I'm the author for the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or <unk> clothes, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an <unk> generally is something that you fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back into the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine made that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle of the middle school, in <unk> <unk> where I was the rare in the class.
And when they were beaten up to bleed every week in the <unk> every week in the time I saved her life.
She saved my life when I could go into the <unk>
I did it in secret.
For three years.
I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, 85 dollars, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to begin to work in organizations who fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call called the <unk> the <unk> lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never come to us.
You could be <unk> and please bring that man who I know you've seen.
And I must tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to stand with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went out to see, <unk> and we realized she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, and it was necessary, and it was necessary for her family, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And like the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult the adult became a box of <unk> became a <unk> box.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, had turned into a circle -- and that <unk> that he talked about it in itself.
<unk> is that death part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the <unk> of it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and <unk>
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, was <unk> trying to understand what he was in front of me.
I <unk> around the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and I couldn't even more to think that it was a <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or the <unk> of the ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are <unk> and they hold to the end, whereas others who are not able to get them more and become a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think about a <unk> which are isolated and separated and alone, as we see us as a human as humans.
But it's the opposite.
As a <unk> of <unk> I'm breathing his ancestral <unk>
And as a <unk> iceberg releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I get my <unk> to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, so that in these unique moments there are not going again.
It's not the death of the <unk> it's not an end, it's not an end, but a continuation next one of its way for the life cycle.
Part of the ice of <unk> <unk> is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are a <unk> iceberg which I photographed in <unk>
It's unlikely to get a <unk> <unk>
Here they are.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and their <unk> line.
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is there.
This is an <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And the <unk> iceberg shows a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine how two two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much of the details of the conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of yes, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And in this scenario I want you to imagine that in a case, the chromosome and sperm <unk>
And in the other case, the X <unk> chromosome on the X <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to them later.
On my ground activity turned on two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with anatomy.
I'm a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way that people came up with the anatomy -- to the anatomy -- human bodies -- of human bodies -- how many human bodies have been thought about the body.
The other role that performance of my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients -- or, as I say sometimes, <unk> people who are doctors.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people within a single body.
I've worked with <unk> people much more than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of many cases of people with <unk> sex individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit in the male <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples of a sense of ways of having sex that are not <unk> in the common ways.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and tell the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life.
And then, in <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual is no receptors in testosterone, the body is not reacting to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there's high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops in a course <unk> <unk>
When you <unk> the baby has a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it is growing and developing the breast, but does not have the menstrual period is going on.
And after doing examinations they realized that rather than having <unk> and <unk> actually <unk>
What's important to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's really not like this.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> <unk>
Most women as I -- I consider a <unk> woman -- doesn't know the <unk> structure, I think is a typical woman most of women who are sensitive to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brains that the woman who was born with testicles that the woman who has been born.
So sex is a complicated thing -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of a way you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 19-year-old who was born and raised like <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships, with her, was wearing a life as <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had chromosomes and the <unk> glands were so active -- that in basically created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone <unk> typically male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> nothing.
And it was the 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman.
Well, another quick example of <unk>
Some people with the brain chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, have tissue tissue wrapped in <unk>
We don't know why that.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason why kids with these kinds of bodies -- so you can be <unk> twins <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they <unk> a number of surgeries that are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea of usually in the idea of a particular anatomy by a particular treatment.
We have the idea that will be a woman who is having an identity <unk> <unk> being black means to have African anatomy in terms of the historical terms.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And when you get a body that shows you something fairly different, we have a problem with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine how amazing that is to have children that are born as two people in a very body.
The highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in <unk> his sex <unk>
A lot of journalists were called to wonder: "What do they test to determine whether to determine whether or <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the journalists who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that you have to admit that nature, you don't plot a line between men and women and women and <unk> and <unk> and women and <unk> we are the ones that we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more importantly, the more we have to admit that these categories of -- the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were a stable little stable that becomes <unk> directly with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the <unk>
We go into a very rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA <unk>
What <unk> <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we deal in science science, we get more and more of a <unk> zone that we have to recognize that <unk> categories.
And we're watching this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions in the day, <unk> not in public, but within the <unk> to when someone is dead.
Our ancestors never had to be <unk> with this question if someone was dead.
As a lot of him to put a little pen in front of his nose, and if he was still not <unk>
If we stopped moving it.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put it on another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a prisoner's dilemma really really <unk> and it puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be celebrating someone like me.
In politics I'm a criminal, and the people with different bodies, but I have to admit that I nervous me.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought of.
<unk> from the point of view of a democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- first I have to admit that I am a fervent <unk> <unk>
I know that they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and a bold and so radical in what they did, that I find myself looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
It's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk> with another <unk> which was radical and beautiful and left for 200 years.
And as you all remember, the <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old people in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea.
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be the political power of the <unk> the father and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the field of play, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered that was the anatomy in common and not <unk>
And in part they were doing because they're a part of a <unk> system, where they were getting two things.
I was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear of course, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations -- so <unk> the concept of <unk> the concept of <unk> a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look -- for example, the Declaration of <unk> <unk> talk about nature and <unk>
Don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of it in that way, but it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
So again, the color people that we <unk> the coincidence of <unk> the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights for a human.
I don't mean that we should be <unk> by anatomy.
I don't want to say that five years of five years to allow them to have sexual relationships.
There are some <unk> <unk> <unk> which I think should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what are, why they are, why they keep any sense.
Well, let's go back to those two different beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> at the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, injustice was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term: I was born a March I was born.
For the fact that having been born three months before Mary attribute to the three months before Mary was attributed every three months before Henry -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered -- if I didn't tell you if it's <unk> by virtue I've never told if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered <unk>
<unk> on your hand, does not have the same rights of marriage that Henry all states, for example.
Henry may marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can get married a woman just in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various ways that we are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is: What do we now do now that science moved so much in the field of anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science.
Where do we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude of <unk> "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man with a man doesn't have to have a <unk> and that to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make tests of the people.
But this is also very strange in the history that I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome that <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, he offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems very <unk>
But how do you do it?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we should be <unk> in this to <unk> rights to people, because I've admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that some humans that I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know that they can make more intelligent <unk> intelligent decisions that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured by an MRI <unk>
We want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems like it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to the other men is susceptible to a sex change in whose case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that a couple of years ago that he had made a couple of <unk> twins.
But when the phone asked the reason for the operation, I was a very <unk> operation, he said in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has been considered the political asylum rather than <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be the <unk> to change the good.
So I think we have to be the head.
Well, to finish that I've been talking I've been talking about <unk>
And I want to think of how it would be a democracy, or like it might have been, if we had given a lot more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say a little bit radical for a <unk> and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming out from different <unk> -- particularly if there are people thinking <unk>
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I have been interested in studying the sexual differences.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all of all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social social relationships to be in the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who I knew that I was interested in feminism -- <unk> as <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've heard.
Feminism has to have to get rid of gender, so there's no women's <unk>
But the more I've thought about his question, most of me as much as I was in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something that is different between the women's brain and the male that makes us more <unk> social relationships to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way that people are to protect people in the state, is possible that we have gotten more <unk> this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity, and think about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks that when every family thinks where it wants to live between at least a handful of different cities in different cities that are competing for to attract new neighborhoods in a different <unk>
Well, at this moment we're out of that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are much more than their building cost.
So we could use it to the <unk> world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound <unk> if you never thought about new cities.
But they just <unk> by buildings by apartments.
So imagine that half that you wanted to live in apartments because they were market and that in the other middle and the other half.
They could try to increase the ability of <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas surrounding them have rules to avoid the <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, to build a small apartments and build a whole new building building, again, always and when rules of that <unk>
So I proposed that the government <unk> new areas of reform are big enough to contain cities and gave them a name: city.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would know that every year to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask for the United States, and they wanted to ask them that those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional financial crisis.
In the next regular election, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform for which <unk> reforms and at the same time.
He asked <unk> who was his <unk> <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of tests with <unk> and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk>
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and adjust to all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it takes a lot of attention to the new technologies for us, and they're usually the rules that support us.
At the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December <unk> we met in Miami, a conference hall.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable cities, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture showing the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square.
But it was a rather abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms, a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> a <unk> which <unk> the rules <unk> and a choice that people can choose if you want to go or live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> me, and he told me we had to do this project, and this is important, this is important, this could be the way that our country comes forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture of it, which included a picture like this, which was a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new <unk> the new airport was built in <unk>
Just this airport cover over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and we have to start with a site that <unk> over a thousand square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came up to the platform, and he said, <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you can see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the TEDTalk.
And this <unk> explained that a new city can offer new choices to people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to might be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of <unk> <unk> need help in <unk> countries might benefit from the country associated with us to establish the countries of the <unk> so that everyone could be able to trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could easily have a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and adding a constitutional <unk> that would allow you to create these special regions.
In a country that had just gone through this crisis, <unk> voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the things in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution you have to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17 was passed again on the <unk> <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on 24 at 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center in the city that's built in North Korea, is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything that you see there was built in four years, after four years getting <unk>
The other interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, it's the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the ultimate court <unk>
There are urban <unk> in cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately again.
There are one million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to stop their family to go to get a job, sometimes they get a job, sometimes they have to make the money for just eating the money to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred around the world?
What does it like to insist for families for families to choose between various cities that are competing for new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there's inside the inside, I'm going to make a confession and I live with <unk>
I love to find <unk> and more recently, to photograph and more recently photographing my blog <unk> <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores to me let me reduce my <unk> impact on the environment and my <unk>
I will come to meet people who usually make my money on a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my <unk> personal <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I will like <unk>
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what you <unk> for this exciting week.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I did.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> in exactly a week is all I put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else that would be able to find everything else that I want to use after you to <unk>
And since I don't know as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, or no, I've learned in this adventure to not use new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be in the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child being inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're good at something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't well look good at something, probably too.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that really understood their meaning.
And I'll explain in a few seconds.
If you believe that you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal kind of personal style, is a great personal way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried over and over and over and over again when people were approaching this week simply because of what he was using.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I left home, I want to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week.
I don't need emotionally to do, emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> and colorful <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side is the <unk> and the right side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if we take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone that's completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I believe that for most the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a big <unk> <unk> in both the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and <unk>
I consider me one of those people, like the same as most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a rather logical logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we develop our intuition to that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
It's a kind of intuition that you may have developed with the past step past the years is the one thing you can be in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk>
I remember watching a child on a parking bar in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the play bar with that bar bar <unk> taught a valuable lesson, and it's that things big things you don't allow them to be in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except you be a physicist.
It would be a terrible model of particle for a particle physicist, so they don't play with parking parking little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they do all kinds of things really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, was the physics of a few years old, needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But not the needed to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but sometimes I not very much.
And I've never seen.
I mean, nobody ever saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the little particles the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't go to the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it doesn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first thing you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then we do a very big approach to the small <unk> small <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little piece of metal, and that <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And then I made this almost the same way you would have a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip new, and I started to work all the big machines for about about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This device has the ability to be in a <unk> <unk> but to that it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable how to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up with doing those things, because I don't want to be doing those things, because I don't want you.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects are the same way.
The <unk> <unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, it's the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on the room and the heat of the room.
And so we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to the <unk> according to the quantum <unk>
And that's what we did.
We <unk> the lights then then <unk> a <unk> and pulled it all the air, and then we put it on a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as you like.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that moved in very strange ways.
Instead of standing perfectly still, and the way it <unk> it was like a breath, it was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and they didn't do it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm going to tell you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about the atoms.
In a case, every trillion the atoms that make up that piece of metal are still that piece of metal -- and at the same time those same atoms are just moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that all of the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between just atom and that metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, and that metal piece can be in two different places.
I mean, that's my logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, how do you be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when you get it, and we turned the lights and look at the lights and look at the box, and we saw that the metal still in a single piece.
And I could come to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk>
You hear a lot about that a lot of <unk> that quantum mechanics is interconnected.
Well, that's not that truth.
It's more than that, is <unk>
That is that those connections, your connections to all the things that are around you, literally define you who you are, and that's the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I got another job on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
I took 18 months and it took 18 to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, <unk> <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story, I think my own story is just this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and travel to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to actually do the desire to do more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great people, and we started to do it.
Better to show the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have done from your launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to go into one of my favorite, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to make it very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the <unk> and with a single click, we jumped inside.
They are inside, that they want to go to the end of the room.
Let's go ahead and get <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I didn't get the better.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of it.
If the museum shows you the image, you click there.
See, here's one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click on there, but I'm clicking here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured what we call the technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression is no price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A little moment <unk>
And I found that the children were actually actually playing with something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some of the people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is hitting a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And it seems very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take you a little bit of perspective, and I'm going to go to the image, really, really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're going very quickly to jump again at MoMA again at MoMA again.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find <unk>
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what van Gogh is actually created by <unk>
It increases and <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen this before.
Let me show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part is called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that day.
You can instead create your own museum for your own museum from all of these images.
It's very simple to walk you -- I've created this function that I call "The Power of <unk> -- we just went out of <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends -- and keep a conversation about what you feel about looking at these <unk> <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even come out of the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment, justice work to their work of art and that is represented in line.
And the great question I do today is, you have made this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a <unk> a flying <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian all the kids in Italy with this picture in your bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened to be very interesting -- which has happened to have happened is that it has happened.
At some time, sometime ago, if you just wanted to win a career of <unk> one, took a budget and put it to a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They are coming back to the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way, and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note of aside I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet but represent 50 percent of the <unk>
75 percent of the <unk> percent of the CO2.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, the environment, begin to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms in the way back sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction as we humans have with the outer environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when <unk> <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end of the <unk> he says the <unk> and he was actually able to see it in Moses -- actually you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and make something.
So let's start with the detection of <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first thing in our lab.
This was four and half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer that was in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the things remember, they were playing <unk> and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day watching activity <unk> on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's tomorrow, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
By the afternoon, early there are people around here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and it goes into the bathroom.
Second time End <unk>
First time <unk> <unk>
<unk> and at one point, the <unk>
She won Italy, <unk>
That night they all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day they all went to the center of the <unk> and the prime minister of then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city of a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, but about things that we use and consume.
Today we know everything about the sources of our objects.
This is a map which shows all the chips that make all the chips that make up a <unk> how are the <unk>
But we know very little about where things go things.
And so in this project, we developed a few little tags that we developed the trash system in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently recently a year more than a year, and you can see, just different kinds of things.
And then we put a little chip, and then we put a little chip, and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
<unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that did not exist.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> is that is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still follows there.
So if we showed that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked at the <unk>
And the first project is something that we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of town, which came and told us that Spain and the south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology believe new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, it was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with water pixels with water.
If you fall the pixels and type in them, show you patterns, you can show you patterns, images, <unk>
And when you zoom in the curtain open and open it as you see in the image.
We present this to the mayor <unk>
He liked this.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the input of the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no gates no windows, but when you go back, it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> <unk>
Or you can close the building and all the architecture like this case.
Those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it goes down almost the whole architecture away.
This is working.
You see people <unk> by what's inside.
And here I'm myself trying not <unk> to test the sensors that open water the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all of the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the <unk> children came into the building because the way we interact had a little bit.
It was not a building that would open you to let you happen, but a building that was still <unk> and a building and <unk> <unk> and you had to jump up for you <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use of people to give our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to <unk> people that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels and the pixels of water and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that the pixels could begin to fly.
So imagine that you could have little <unk> helicopters in the air, and that every one had a small pixel in the air it changes as if it was a cloud that is moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw earlier, that moves with each other in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
A flexible screen, like this with a normal <unk> configuration.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, which what changes is light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
So imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all that that could be a cloud of pixels in a 3D cloud that you can stand and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light, the light, it looks like this, the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them with a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, and so on, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star in New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements in and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> real-time capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable thing that's happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, moving the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and that's accessible through the Internet.
Today, and the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, from power to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how will happen from digital world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but <unk>
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be to share the main moments of the top Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, as a new top of a new top of London.
You can go in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but most importantly, it will be a new experience for anybody to go to top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, can improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be more <unk> to be more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure ourselves?
How about living in good health?
Or maybe be that people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the <unk>
What would you do if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> you probably had to have the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many <unk>
So a few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe even is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> <unk> here at the TED conference today, but I want to give you a little doctor on the issue.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which in the <unk> Church, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote an trial called <unk>
But if they effectively accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It comes to other other or ourselves?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, is very well at one end, it is, of course, the more us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There has been maybe 20 or 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some people have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk>
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same <unk> but it's the <unk> which comes from pancreatic <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the gut of the <unk> cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> you asked you about the <unk> you think of <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully pristine environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm <unk> <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that may want without effort.
It's really like a quick thing for bacteria to the occasional <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk>
But by the other, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something or better at <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as only and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope that you have <unk>
When I first <unk> I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell to the cell <unk>
But when the <unk> organisms are starting to change.
It's the sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of death of the body comes into evolution at sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student when I was thinking, <unk> <unk> death -- a lot of <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but every year he was born.
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas right now.
And one night someone hit his door door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he's found a magnificent <unk> <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Good says, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted to live more and more in a healthier ways.
Evolution consists of going through the genome to the next <unk> "We and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary standpoint, you and I are the <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then we will fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that put in Woody Allen when he said, "I want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily allow for longevity.
It doesn't necessarily give it the biggest or the stronger or the stronger or the <unk>
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there would have fish there that would be fish there, which would be a <unk> environment.
So what do this, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to the place of humans in evolution, and in particular in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is not <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the most underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been been <unk> and hide from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so we get to get us to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> we are so much not possible to have the isolation necessary thing to happen.
A second possibility is that you get a second evolution of nature, natural <unk> forces.
And the argument here is that the <unk> of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when as a species, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing <unk> intriguing possibility, intriguing and frightening.
I call the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to be <unk>
Think also that if it was possible to be able to choose not only sex in their <unk> sex in their own body to cure to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic change for eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's risk or to remove the <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future kind of changes to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
At the next year we finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of three three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to 20,000 and a week.
They didn't make a lot of so that the human genome is to get the human genome to be more and more at the rest.
There are these changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin can make viruses that are not only going to protect us, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no one of an experimental trial in experimental <unk> with the flu vaccine <unk>
Can you imagine something nice about the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just two other two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate the diabetes, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who don't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes of diseases, it's going to allow us to also embrace <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the genius of a <unk> Ken <unk> especially if you <unk> with the next generation of the machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle faster than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live more time?
This will be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of introducing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to be the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices into a better society.
Or we're going to <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest things of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom to make these <unk> decisions.
To be good or worse, and before what could these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 <unk>
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one who could be talking to <unk>
So immediately they looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably have some <unk>
The pilot already had been <unk> and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not <unk>
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being in a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words that have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
Was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before of dying, and we have this list of things that we want to get in life, and I thought about all the things that I wanted to get in and not I did, all the fences that I wanted to get in and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I will open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in the life.
And that urgency, really, has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the <unk> the George Washington bridge -- which was not very much -- I thought about, <unk> really a big <unk> I feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity it also led to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time to be involved in things that didn't work with people who matter.
And I thought of my relationship with my wife, with my wife, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
Within two years, I didn't have a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is sort of like your mental watch <unk> <unk> <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want that this is broken in 20 pieces of pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life. I love my life.
And that sadness are <unk> in a single thought, which is just a thing.
I wish I could see my kids to grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- not a lot of artistic <unk> --  -- I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is being a good parent.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave the one another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live again.
You who are flying in today, the challenge you can see that the same thing on your airplane -- and please be -- but imagine, and how do you get it -- but imagine, and how do you start?
What is that <unk> who are still waiting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I certainly had been blessed with a lot of projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> years.
And one day he came home after he went home and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design and a piece of design and a graffiti thing, that's a graffiti thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What's going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk with Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he and he will be able to communicate with me.
And I said, "A second, I said, "A second, to see Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate with those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have a very good good, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable to people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Somebody to see the film "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
They communicate in that way. They're going to get it with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How do it be?"
So I introduced myself to just deliver a check, and instead of giving it a check and instead of a check that I didn't have the least idea of how it was to <unk>
I was <unk> with his brother and his father there at the very moment, "All right, this is the Tony Tony is going to build a machine, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find one machine, and we're going to find it again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inside can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw about that negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of all, they start with sex organs -- then with the <unk> attacks and, at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, about a year later, after a lot later, and a lot of moving things on one side to another one we achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of the insurance companies and we get a machine so that you could make a machine as Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And, seriously, about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email and you get an email on it. This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> world to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the <unk> and these hackers and programmers and <unk> they took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when we <unk> it would have taken off the walls of the walls and their place.
But for two weeks of <unk> I went to <unk> <unk> <unk> my son was part, and we create this.
It's called <unk>
They are a pair of concrete <unk> that we buy on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some of the copper copper <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> the light -- over an LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds up with the <unk> we published the <unk> <unk> the software <unk> <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company <unk>
There is no hospital I can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> hall.
I love this picture because this is a room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after a year of planning, two weeks of programming programming programming programming all of the entire night, Tony again.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a slide projector on a wall outside of the hospital.
And he started drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take you in the parking lot so that we feel like if we were <unk> that is as well.
At the end of this, he sent us email and this was what he said, "This was the first time that I was in seven years.
I felt as if he had been under the water and someone finally came to come to <unk> and get me out there so I could get it out there so I could get it out there.
It's not <unk>
In some form that is a <unk>
That's what keeps us on movement.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential it deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to make it and make it faster and <unk>
We've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the top <unk> of 2010, and was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up about closing the <unk> is that in April in Los Angeles <unk> in Los Angeles -- is going to have an exhibition called <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> <unk> urban art -- <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, doing possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the computer, the <unk> nothing was possible.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find us every day when we find that something that we feel like to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations generally very difficult at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> difficult zones and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just a lot of fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career I've been <unk> in situations like awful me in awful situations with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that make social questions about social issues, and hopefully analyzing them from a way that you can see <unk>
So when I knew that I was going to come here and do a TEDTalk over the brands and I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard this ear, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some Facebook messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of my <unk>
What had been the next thing -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it's about and according to the face, and as if I put it in a face, especially if you put it in ridiculous for you or for you to do it.
But I said this is a very good chance.
You know how much people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew that somebody was going to buy your name.
If you had asked me a year ago a year ago for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the <unk> world of <unk> the <unk>
And as I said before, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing I could get in horrible situations in the last years or so dangerous to the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about <unk> products, the marketing and advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and <unk>
The film is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> is that everything from up at the bottom, at the end, it has a brand, all the time; all the time; all the time; all the time; all the time marks the title <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film -- it explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> <unk> It's <unk> <unk> to <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> but we're going to make sure it <unk> all the categories that we can be in the film.
You may have a shoe -- and it becomes the most cool shoe of <unk>
The most cool car that you have driven in "The <unk> <unk> the greatest drink that you've ever driven -- the best drink you have.
<unk>
The <unk> <unk> is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea -- the whole film to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time you hear that.
<unk> However, I don't know how they're going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> John <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be a hard time to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, you know, maybe for the moment that comes to the film, let's see it as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most answers will be <unk>
MS: But will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be me?
JK: Two things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at people who you have to be <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought I thought that <unk> meant has a conversation.
<unk> the camera means "I don't want to know anything about your <unk>
