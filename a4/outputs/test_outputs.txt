You know what I do is to write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, and, in fact, I'm the author for the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or <unk> clothes, and never nobody has chosen for a farmer.
I'm here to talk today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an <unk> generally is something that you fell somewhere else.
You just have to turn the apple back into the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine made that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle of the middle school, in <unk> <unk> where I was the rare in the class.
And when they were beaten up to bleed every week in the <unk> every week she saved me the life.
She saved my life when I could go into the <unk>
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, 85 dollars, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to begin to work in organizations who fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call phone for half the night I received a phone call phone -- the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never come to us.
You could be <unk> and please bring that man who I know you've seen.
And I must tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to stand with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went out to see, <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, and we would need to.
It's something we knew how to do.
And like the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult the adult became a box of <unk> became a <unk> box.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, had turned into a circle -- and that <unk> that he talked about it in itself.
<unk> is that death part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the <unk> of it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is important to me.
Through my work, I am trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and <unk>
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, was <unk> trying to understand what he was in front of me.
I <unk> around the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and I couldn't even more to think that it was a <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the ice walls.
Every single iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are <unk> and they hold off to the end, whereas others who are not able to get them more and more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think about a <unk> which are isolated and separated and alone, as we see us as a human as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> of <unk> I'm breathing his ancestral <unk>
As a measure of a <unk> which is the richest water releases in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits -- as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, that knowing that in these unique moments they are going again.
It's not the death of the death -- it's not an end, it's not an end, but a continuation next one of its way for the life cycle.
Part of the ice of <unk> <unk> is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures that I'd like to show you are a <unk> iceberg which I photographed in <unk>
It's very often, to get a <unk> <unk>
Here they are.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and their <unk> line.
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing up there.
This is an <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so the <unk> iceberg shows a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine for two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much of the details of the conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of yes, not to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And in this scenario I want you to imagine that in a case, the chromosome and sperm <unk>
And in the other case, the X <unk> chromosome into the X <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to them later.
And in my ground activity turned into two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way that people came up with the anatomy -- to the anatomy -- human bodies -- how many human bodies have been considered the body fluid -- what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance of my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients -- or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> <unk> people who are doctors.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people within a single body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of many cases of people with <unk> sex individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit in the male <unk>
In general, we can be <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples of some ways that you have a sex that are not <unk> in the common form of a <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and tell the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life.
And then, in <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual is no receptors in testosterone, the body is not reacting to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome is <unk>
So there's high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops in a course <unk> <unk>
When you <unk> the baby has a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it is growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period -- when someone is going to realize something is going on.
And after doing examinations they realized that rather than having <unk> and <unk> actually <unk>
What's important to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's really not like this.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
The majority of women like me -- I was not known as the <unk> <unk> does not know the <unk> <unk> I believe to be a typical woman of women like me.
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me have the most exposed brain <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> which has <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of a way you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 19-year-old who was a 19 year-old <unk> and raised her with her, he was wearing a life as a kid and had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th <unk> <unk> <unk> glands were so active that, in basically creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone <unk> typically male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> nobody <unk>
And it was the 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of <unk>
Some people with the brain chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, have tissue tissue wrapped in <unk>
We don't know why that.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason why kids with these kinds of bodies -- so you can be <unk> twins <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it is to <unk> several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that particular a particular anatomy that particular brings it to <unk>
We have the idea that will be a woman that is to have an <unk> <unk> <unk> being black means to have African anatomy in terms of the historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you get a body that shows you something quite different, you have a lot of problems with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine how amazing that is to have children that are born as two people in a very body.
The highest case is the last year with the African African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists were called to wonder: "What do they test to determine whether to determine whether or <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the journalists who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that you have to admit that nature, you don't plot a line between men and women and women or between men and <unk> and <unk> and women and <unk> we are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more importantly, the more we have to admit that these categories where the more of us -- we had to admit that these categories -- that we thought were kind of a stable that was going on directly to <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the <unk>
We go into a very rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA <unk>
What do we <unk> the fact from them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into science and we get more and more and more in a very awkward zone that we have to recognize that <unk> categories.
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions in the day, <unk> not in public, but within the <unk> to when someone is dead.
Our ancestors never have to have to do with this question if someone was dead.
As a lot of him to put a little pen in front of his nose, and if he was still not <unk>
If I stopped moving it down.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put it on another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with a prisoner's dilemma really really <unk> and it puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be celebrating someone like me.
And in politics I am a criminal, and the people with different bodies, but I have to admit that it gets nervous.
We <unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought of.
It was <unk> from the point of view.
And to tell you about this tension -- first I have to admit that I am a fervent <unk> <unk> <unk>
I know that they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and <unk> and so radical in what they did, that I find myself so that musical watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
It's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk> with the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> with another <unk> which was radical and beautiful and left for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what the <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old people in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of a <unk>
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be the political power of the <unk> the father and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the field of game and decided that the anatomy of the game, was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences.
And in part they were doing because they're a part of a <unk> system where they were getting two things.
I was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear of course, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations -- so <unk> the concept of <unk> the concept of <unk> a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look -- for example, the Declaration of <unk> <unk> talk about nature and <unk>
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
So again, the color people that we <unk> the coincidence of <unk> the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't mean that we should be <unk> by anatomy.
I don't want to say that five years of five years to allow them to have sexual relationships.
There are some <unk> <unk> <unk> which I think should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what are, why they are, why they keep any sense.
Well, let's go back to those two different beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> at the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, injustice was born three months before the time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term: I was born a March I was born.
For the fact that having been born three months before Mary attribute to the three months before Mary was attributed every three months before Henry -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered -- if I didn't tell you if it's <unk> by virtue I've never told if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered <unk>
<unk> on your hand, does not have the same rights of marriage that Henry all states, for example.
Henry may be married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can get married a woman just in some states.
So we still do <unk> categories that in various ways that we are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is: What do we now do now that science moved so much in the anatomy of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a sort of <unk> attitude of <unk> "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man with a man doesn't have to have a <unk> and that to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make tests of the people.
But this is also very strange in the history that I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome that <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems very <unk>
But how do you do it?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we should be <unk> in this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of the <unk> that some humans that I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know that they can make more intelligent <unk> intelligent decisions that I know.
So how do we put the issue on the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured by an MRI <unk>
We want to do that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems like it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to other men is susceptible to to be <unk> in which case it is to be a living.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that a couple of years ago that he had made a couple of <unk> identical <unk>
But when the phone asked the reason for the operation, I was a very <unk> operation, he said in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has been considered the political asylum rather than <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change around the state.
So I think we have to be the head.
Well, to finish the end of the way, I mean I've been talking about <unk>
And I want to think of what it would be a democracy, or like it might have been, if we had given a lot more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say a little bit radical for a <unk> and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming out from different <unk> -- particularly if there are people thinking <unk>
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I have been interested in studying the sexual differences.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk>
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who I knew that I was interested in feminism -- <unk> as <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of gender, so there is no women's <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, the more that I think is a female <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something that is different between the female brains and the male that makes us more <unk> social relationships to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way they protect people in the state, it's possible that we have been more <unk> of the state, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we get the democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity, and think about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between the other different cities that they're competing for to attract new neighborhoods in which they are competing for the new residents to attract new residents at the way they are competing for the new residents.
Well, at this moment we're out of that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are much more than their building cost.
So we could use it to the <unk> world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound <unk> if you never thought about new cities.
But they just <unk> by buildings by apartments.
So imagine that half that you wanted to live in apartments already as a owners and that the other half will still stop to do it.
They could try to increase the ability of <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are the standards that are in order to avoid the <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, to build a whole new building building, new apartment building and when the rules of that <unk> it will rather than <unk>
So I proposed that the government <unk> new areas of reform are big enough to contain cities and gave them a name: city.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would know that every year to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask for the United States, and they wanted to ask them that those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional financial crisis.
In the next regular election, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and in the same time.
He asked <unk> who was his <unk> <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried and a lot of evidence with users, and I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk>
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and adjust to all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it takes a lot of attention to the new technologies for us, and they're usually the rules that keep us going.
At the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December <unk> we met in Miami, a conference hall.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are the cities, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture showing the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, worth a thousand dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and a very abstract argument at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms, a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> a <unk> which is a <unk> which is a <unk> which <unk> the rules that you can choose if you want to go or live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> me, and told me we had to do this project, and this is important, and so said that we had to do this project, is important, this could be the way our country forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk again about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture of it, which included a picture like this, which was a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new <unk> the new airport was built in <unk>
Just this airport just cover over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and we have to start with a site that <unk> over a thousand square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came up to the platform, and he said, <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you can see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can be providing new choices for the people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to might be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of <unk> <unk> would need aid from countries that could help to be able to make the countries associated with them and make the rules of the <unk> so that everyone could be able to trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This photo is from there.
It could easily have a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and adding a constitutional <unk> that would allow you to create these special regions.
In a country that had just gone through this crisis, <unk> voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the things in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution you have to pass twice a in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over once in the <unk> <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on 24 at 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that's built in North Korea, is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything that you see there was built in four years, after four years getting <unk>
The other interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, it's the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the ultimate court <unk>
There are urban <unk> in cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know that they have solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately again.
There are one million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to stop their family to go to get a job, sometimes they get a job, sometimes they have to make the money for just eating the money to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city of a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred around the world?
What does it like to insist for families for families to choose between various cities that are competing for new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there are inside the inside, I'm going to make a confession and I live with <unk>
I love to find -- and more recently to photograph and more recently photograph and more of my blog <unk> <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores to me let me reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I will come to meet people who usually get my money on a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal <unk> <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I'm going to like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what you <unk> for this exciting week.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I'm trying to show you.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> <unk> and nothing else.
So in exactly a week in exactly a week is all I put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else that would be able to find everything else that I want to use after we got up here.
And since I don't know as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, or no, I've learned in this adventure to not use new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life, trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just let you get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child being inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember her little <unk>
I like <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're good at something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think that you don't well look good at something, probably too.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you believe that you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't look at you that you can't afford it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to get everything that we want to make everything that we want it.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The <unk> <unk> are <unk>
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal kind of personal style -- and only is a great personal way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried over and over and over and over again when people were approaching this week simply because of what he was using.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I left home, I want to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to let it back certain things.
I don't need emotionally to believe these things, because of these things, because there is always another other <unk> and bright and bright <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side is the <unk> and the right side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for the most members of this audience, but I think for most members of this <unk> in both of the time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and <unk>
I consider me one of those people, like the same as most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see them as they react. And then we develop our intuition to that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
It's a kind of intuition that you may have developed with the next step of the years is that it says that one thing can be in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk>
And I remember watching a child playing a <unk>
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the play bar with that bar bar with that bar <unk> taught a valuable lesson, and it's the big things you don't allow them to be in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except that you are a particle of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist -- because they don't play with parking car <unk> tiny particles.
And when they play with their particles, they do all kinds of things really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years old, needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But not the needed to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not very often with the particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but sometimes I not very much.
And I've never seen.
I mean, nobody ever saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the little particles the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't have the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it doesn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first thing you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand a little bit a little bit of a little bit on the center.
And then we do a very big approach to the small <unk> small <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little piece of metal, and that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I made this almost the same way you would have a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a mixed room with a new silicon chip -- and I started to work all the big machines for about about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This device has the ability to be in an <unk> quantum <unk> but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people you get out of doing those things, because I don't want to be doing those things, because I don't want to be <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects are behave in the same way.
The <unk> <unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, it's the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on the room and the heat of the room.
And so we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to the <unk> according to the quantum <unk>
And that's what we did.
We <unk> the lights then then <unk> a <unk> and pulled it all the air, and then we put it on a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as you like.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that moved in very strange ways.
Instead of standing perfectly still, and the way it <unk> it was like a breath of this way -- like a breath -- it was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and they didn't do it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm going to tell you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about the atoms.
In a case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal is still that piece of metal -- and at the same time those same atoms are just moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that all of the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between just atom and that metal is kind of more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and metal piece is like the difference between that little metal and metal <unk>
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, and that metal piece can be in two different places.
I mean, this is my logical part of the logic of it.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, how do you be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when it was that, and we turned the lights and look at the lights and look at the box, and we saw that the metal still in a single piece.
And I could come to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk>
You hear a lot about that is a lot of about that quantum mechanics is <unk>
Well, that's not that truth.
It's more than that, it's more than that, is more profound.
That is that those connections, your connections to all the things that are around you -- literally define you who you are, and that's the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was a Google job to Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
I took 18 months and it took 18 for 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, <unk> <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just one of my own story, just this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I had no access to a lot of these museums and works of art.
And so when I started traveling and go to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to actually do the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great people, and we started to do it.
Better to show the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have done from your launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to go into one of my favorite, the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the <unk> and with a single click, we jumped inside.
They are inside, that they want to go to the end of the room.
Let's go ahead and get <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of it.
If the museum shows you the image, you click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on the same right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured what we call the technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression is no price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A little moment, this seems like <unk>
And I found that the children were actually actually playing with something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some of the people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is hitting a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take you a little bit of perspective, and I'm going to take you the image, you really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're going very quickly to jump again at MoMA again at MoMA again.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find <unk>
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what van Gogh is actually created by <unk>
It increases and <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part is called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that day.
You can online to create your own museum for your own museum from all of these images.
It's very simple, you walk -- I've created this function that I call the power of <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
This is <unk> <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to their friends and to keep a conversation about what they feel at looking at these <unk> <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things not really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even come out of the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media will do for its work of art and it's represented properly in line.
And the great question that you do today is, you have made this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a <unk> a flying <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian all the kids in Italy with this picture on your bedroom. But the reason why I show you this is that it has happened -- which has happened to have happened is that it has happened.
There was some time, if you wanted to win a career for the year -- I took a budget and put it on a budget and put it on a good car, and you get a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What is interesting today is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They are turning computers in the open air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note of aside I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet but represent 50 percent of the <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, the environment, begin to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms that are back sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction as we humans have with the outer environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when <unk> <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end of the <unk> he says the <unk> and he was actually able to see it in Moses -- actually you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and make something.
So let's start with the detection of <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first thing in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer that was a summer with 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the things remember, they were playing <unk> and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day watching activity <unk> on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's tomorrow, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
By the afternoon, early there are people around here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people do a quick call and it goes into the bathroom.
Second time End of time. End of time.
First time <unk> <unk>
<unk> and at one point, the <unk>
She won Italy, <unk>
That night they all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day they all went to the center of the <unk> and the prime minister of then.
And then everybody went down.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city of a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, but about things that we use and consume.
Today we know everything about the sources of our objects.
This is a map which shows all the chips that all the chips that make us a <unk> how are the <unk>
But we know very little about where things go things.
So in this project, we developed some little tags that we developed the trash system in your shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently recently a year more than a year ago, and you can see what they were looking at all <unk> ways.
And then we put a little chip, and then we put a little chip, and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
This is <unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that was before not exist.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> is that is still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle that we put a day is still there, it still follows there.
So if we showed that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked at the very beginning, which is the beginning of the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of town, which came and told us that Spain and the south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, "How can technology technology new technology can come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, it was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with water pixels with water.
If you fall the pixels and type in them, show you patterns, you can show you patterns, images, <unk>
And when you zoom in the curtain open and open it as you see in the image.
We present this to the mayor <unk>
He liked this.
And we had a commission to design the building to the input of the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no gates no windows, but when you come up and open up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> <unk>
Or you can close the building and all the architecture it disappears, in this case.
Those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, somebody who was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it goes down almost the whole architecture away.
This is working.
You see the <unk> people in the <unk>
And here I'm myself trying not <unk> to test the sensors that open water the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all of the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the <unk> children came into the building because the way we interact had a little bit.
It was not a building that would open you to let you happen, but a building that was still <unk> and a building <unk> and you had to jump out and jump up for you to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use of people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to <unk> people that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels and the pixels of water and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that the pixels could begin to fly.
So imagine that you could have little <unk> helicopters in the air and that every one had a small pixel in the air is a small <unk> which is a cloud that is moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw earlier, that moves with each other in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
A flexible screen, like this with a normal <unk> configuration.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, which what changes is light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
So imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all that that could be a cloud of pixels in the 3D <unk> that you can be <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light, the light, it looks like this, the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of each of them with a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from people, from the movement, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star in New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements in and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> you see them in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> real-time capture.
It can be <unk>
You can go through all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable thing that's happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, moving the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and that's accessible through the Internet.
Today, and the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, from power to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how will happen from digital world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but <unk>
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be to share the main moments of the top Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, as a new top of a new top of London.
You can go in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, can improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be more <unk> to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure ourselves?
How about living in good health?
Or maybe be out of those people who wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk> thing.
What would you do if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> you probably had to have the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many <unk>
So a few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that is even possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> <unk> here at the TED conference today, but I want to give you a little doctor on the issue.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which in the <unk> Church, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called <unk>
But if they effectively accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about other other or ourselves?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, right on one end, is, of course, the more us.
<unk> of a common ancestor about the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some people have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk>
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same <unk> but it's the <unk> which comes from pancreatic <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the gut of the <unk> cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> they asked them about the <unk> they think of <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully pristine environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm <unk> <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that may want without effort.
It's really like a quick <unk> of bacteria with the occasional <unk> in the <unk>
But by the other, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what are the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, which is perhaps better at <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope that you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life -- in the <unk> organisms -- each cell to be divide and all the genetic energy of that cell lives.
But when the <unk> organisms are starting to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of death of the body comes into evolution at sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student was thinking, <unk> <unk> death -- <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but every year he was born.
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas right now.
And one night someone hit his door door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he's found a magnificent <unk> <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Good says, George, I choose the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted it to live more and more and more so on.
Evolution consists of going through the genome to the next <unk> "We and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary standpoint, you and I are the <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then we will fall into the sea.
I think that all of the feeling that I put in Woody Allen when he said, <unk> I want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily allow for longevity.
It doesn't necessarily give it the biggest or the stronger or the stronger or the <unk>
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there would have fish there that would be fish there, fish, but they've managed to do that an <unk> environment.
So what do this, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to the place where we humans in evolution, and in particular in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that they didn't exist.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the <unk> underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that another way they would have been to have been <unk>
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so we get to get us to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we <unk> so much that it is not possible to have the isolation necessary thing to happen.
A second possibility is that you can get a <unk> evolution of nature, natural <unk> forces.
And the argument here is that the <unk> of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when as a species, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, an intriguing <unk> intriguing possibility, intriguing and frightening.
I call the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing having more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to be <unk>
Think also that if it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to heal genetic settings or preventing disease.
And if we could make the genetic change for eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's risk or to remove the <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future kind of changes to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
For the next year we finished, in 2004, I could get the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of three three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to 20,000 and a week.
They didn't make a lot of so that the human genome is going to be the human genome to be more and more at the rest.
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or no experimental trial is there an experimental <unk> which is the vaccine against the flu vaccine plant.
You can imagine a good thing going out of the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just two other two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> egg and to change their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate the diabetes, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who don't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes of diseases, it's going to allow us to also have to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so if you I could get you with the next generation of the next <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle faster than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of introducing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to be the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are going to have to have to them.
We're going to use these choices into a better society, more <unk>
Or we go to selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest things of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 <unk>
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one that I could talk about with the flight.
So immediately they looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably have some <unk>
The pilot already had been <unk> and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three years later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not <unk>
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being in a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three more <unk> words that you have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
Was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before of dying, and we have this list of things to the people that I wanted to get in and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to get in and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I will open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in the life.
And that urgency, of course, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as long as the bridge George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, <unk> really a great <unk> I feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity it also gives my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time to <unk> in things that don't really work with people who do matter.
And I thought of my relationship with my wife, with my wife, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
Within two years, I've not had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason to be <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental watch <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want that this is broken in 20 pieces of pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want me to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness are <unk> in a single thought, which is just a thing.
I wish I could see my kids to grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- not a lot of artistic <unk> --  -- I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave the one another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live again.
You who are flying in today, the challenge you can see that the same thing on your airplane -- and please be -- but imagine, and how do you get it -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is that <unk> that they still wait to do because they think they're going to live for <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been in a lot of living with a lot of projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> years.
And one day he came home after a day came home and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design and a piece of design and a graffiti thing, that's a graffiti thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk with Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he was able to communicate with me.
And I said, "A second, I said, "A second, to see Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate with those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have a very good good, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable to people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Somebody to see the film "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're going to get it with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How do it be?"
So I introduced myself to just deliver a check, and instead of giving it a check and rather than it was a check that didn't have the least idea of how it was to <unk>
I was <unk> with his brother and his father there at the very moment, "All right, this is the Tony Tony is going to build a machine, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inside can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw about that negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of all, they start with sex organs -- then with the <unk> attacks and, at the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, about a year later, after a lot later, and a lot of moving things on one side to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of the insurance companies and we get a machine so that you could build a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email on it, and you say, "I don't know. This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> world to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the <unk> and these hackers and programmers and <unk> they took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and that when we <unk> it would have taken the frames walls and that in their place.
But for two weeks of <unk> I was the <unk> <unk> <unk> my son was part, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun <unk> that we buy on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some of the copper copper <unk> <unk> <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> the light -- over an LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds up with the <unk> we published the <unk> <unk> the software <unk> <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say <unk>
There is no hospital I can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using it alone.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the end of the <unk>
I love this picture because this is a room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after a year of planning, two weeks of programming programming programming programming all of the entire night, Tony <unk> to draw in for the first time.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a slide projector on a wall outside of the hospital.
And he came back to the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to pull it down in the parking lot so that we feel like we were in the parking lot as well.
At the end of this, he sent us email and this was what he said, "This was the first time that I was in seven years.
I felt like he would have been under the water and somebody finally came up with the water and let me come up and get me out there, and get me out there so I could get it out there.
It's not <unk>
In a certain way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us working movement.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential it deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to make it and make it faster and <unk>
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the top <unk> of 2010, and was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up about closing the <unk> is that in April in Los Angeles <unk> in Los Angeles -- is going to have an exhibition called <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> <unk> urban art -- <unk> <unk> -- all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible -- do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the computer, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology simply recognized something and <unk> with amazing people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find us every day when we find that something that we feel like it is to be done. If it's not now, <unk> -- and if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years, in situations generally very difficult and very difficult at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
They were in <unk> difficult zones and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating a lot of fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been <unk> in situations like awful me in horrible situations with the only goal to try to examine social questions in the ways that make social questions about social issues, and hopefully analyzing them from a way that you can see <unk>
So when I knew that I was coming here to do a TEDTalk over the brands and I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard this ear, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some Facebook messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of my <unk>
What had been the next thing -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it's about and according to the face, and as if I put it in a face, especially if you put it in ridiculous for you or for you to do it.
But I said this is a very good chance.
You know how much people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew that somebody was going to buy your name.
If you had asked me a year ago for a year ago, I would never have been able to have certainty.
But in the new film that I am working in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the <unk> world.
And as I said before, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing I could get in horrible situations in the last years or so dangerous as to the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and <unk>
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> is that everything from up at the bottom, at the end, it has <unk> <unk> all the time; all the time; all the time; all the time; all the time marks the title <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film -- it explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> <unk> It's <unk> <unk> to <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was more by <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> but we're going to make sure it <unk> all the categories that we can be in the film.
You may have a shoe -- and it becomes the most cool shoe of <unk>
The most cool car that you have driven in "The <unk> <unk> the greatest drink that you've ever driven -- the best drink you have.
<unk> <unk> The idea is so much about showing brands the brands like a part of life, making it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> <unk> is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea -- the whole film to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time that I hear -- is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how it is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> John <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but surely it's going to be a hard time to convince you a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, you know, maybe for the moment that comes to the film, let's see it as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think that is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most answers will be <unk>
MS: But will be hard for the film to be <unk> by the film to be me?
JK: Both things both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I was <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think of the brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to be <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "I don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was one for one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present to the product as many people as possible, as possible, as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of separate media -- is not the idea to count with that new vehicle worthy vehicle that's going to lead to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was like this.
In fact, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that <unk>
I like the <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president was <unk> even the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really something that it changes really something it changes it.
But why? Well, transparency is <unk> --  -- like that <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a bowl of <unk> <unk> a bowl of <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and say, "No, we want them to <unk> history.
We want it to be a story, but we want a story, but <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father told me in some lie -- and he's looking at him as a single <unk> saying, "Son, there is three sides of every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, a agency and a agency to help me -- and that just because I knew to John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go for my own <unk> I would have to take the <unk>
So what I started to figure out all of a sudden -- which I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies that when you start talking with your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends that make big, <unk> giant <unk> and others making small movies, <unk> like mine.
And my friends make movies of big, giant Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies is so successful that the brands are associated with them.
And then my friends make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk> giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The <unk> <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open up and every time I open up my <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can tell you "Are you fine <unk> to this <unk>
You're ready? You ready? You get a bit nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
Both of the <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> are going to have their chance.
We're going to have so much for man to be <unk> solid, and <unk>
That's the general record.
Now I can answer his questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We are a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we are <unk> we are rather a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people is the reason that we are interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: Social <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you get in the <unk>
Man: Man: I talk about something audacious, <unk>
I think that <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you very cool.
How do we keep them cool more time? And how do we keep them cool more time? Hopefully better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man on the street, people like me, to the <unk>
They have to talk me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: Man: I <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good <unk>
Woman: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: Okay, okay, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique.
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
Usually I wear toilet <unk> like sunglasses, and I like <unk> and <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: <unk> I am, I would call it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: On a <unk> <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the type of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> <unk>
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand for Tom, but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go in my head, someone I could go in my head, and someone who could help me understand what they call <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they probably could do it for me.
You get the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: giving me a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of it.
MS: These people do my way to see the world.
Number three:
MS: That world? I think your world is the way that your world is in which you are around your friends, the friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things you come in and you start in a place and you start in a place and you start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: how do it relate to your thoughts, feelings that do with your thoughts, feelings to be?
MS: It's like who wanted to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
Number three: Tell me what that serves to do that?
What's the <unk> Where is the <unk> Where are you right now?
Why is this important important? What is the <unk> What are the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
<unk> little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be fear. What kind of <unk> are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: I thank you for your patience. Big <unk> A <unk> A: Yes. Thank you very much.) Thank you very much.)
MS: Yes, I don't know what is going out of this.
There was a lot of madness on all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand <unk>
It was very well <unk> together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that they're not <unk> avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them a positive thing to you, and you make something positive for you, and you make something positive here.
What other brands are like this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and <unk> <unk> those things that have been coming and come and come and get a very powerful.
MS: An <unk> What's your <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asked you to get your identity identity identity, your brand, which would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're a <unk>
Or you're more like a <unk> <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like being playful is cool as a cool thing is to be cool is like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or you're more than <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> you're <unk> with <unk>
You are <unk> <unk> familiar, <unk> safe, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be a part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they would have control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film, how you use the magnetic resonance centers in the brain as well for film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way in the schools with issues in the United States.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest response or the ones that I've had the most successful answer or that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> they took their <unk> they took their <unk> and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something different, something which is going to do with people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do it gone? They had <unk>
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two and a half weeks ago.
That's only in <unk> or press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win the <unk>
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies agencies we talk to you to their <unk>
I have always believed that if you <unk> if you take risks if you take risks that you have opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that is pushing them on failure.
I believe that when you train their employees in loss <unk> at risk that is to be preparing rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who not to have a fear of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we have to give them a place to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk> fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor the transparency.
More than not a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my whole talk, has been presented by my <unk> friends who have been presented by my good friends in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in behalf of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check for the name of the <unk> <unk> <unk> Foundation for <unk> <unk> to be applied to my TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His greatest active weapons to develop nuclear weapons is <unk> in <unk>
The gray <unk> that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus of Windows in a portable computer engineer -- this gray box is gray, and we are ready.
This is the behind behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program <unk> is <unk> mission.
It's easy, right.
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching about <unk> about six months, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that called us attention -- and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
And so they went very strange.
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> <unk> that he didn't like our <unk> -- but he didn't want to eat.
I didn't make any sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at the gray box in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on this <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be -- let's say, for example, a power plant, or the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better to <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the seizure code, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> a big little and a big.
We also saw that they were very <unk> by people who obviously had the entire internal information.
We would have all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much it <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample from this code.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks like the old language.
I want to tell you how we could find that code.
What we were looking at the beginning was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and structures of data and tried <unk> with the real world with potential world.
We need theories about <unk> which we can be <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember -- which is definitely a <unk> <unk> must be a <unk> white should be a <unk> white <unk>
They are not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> nuclear power plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
And I called them and I ended up in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell phones within the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly be <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow, and <unk> in an obvious effort going back to the <unk> engineers who couldn't solve this very quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital digital <unk> looking very close to data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started research literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called the <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> Iran are <unk> in 15 stages.
And guess what we found in the <unk> code.
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
So that's not like this is not like this.
The results have been that after several weeks of hard work.
We had <unk> <unk> on dead <unk> and we had to start again.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would come to one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small <unk> he's taking a waterfall, and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have a certain <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you very interesting things that we saw some very interesting things.
There's the gray box and the top, you see the <unk>
What does this thing is <unk> the values of <unk> the sensors for pressure sensors for pressure sensors and provide <unk> which is still <unk> which is still on the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input is <unk> by <unk>
It's like Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera fed <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the fourth <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator can't act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine is <unk> you have to open <unk> valves is to open a <unk> valves in a <unk>
Of course, this can't do that a human operator anymore.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And we don't have the <unk> not the security system.
That scares <unk>
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about that. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk>
It could also work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk> an <unk>
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> to disseminate this burden with a key <unk> like we saw in <unk>
You could use conventional technology <unk> <unk>
It would be as possible.
And if you made that, if you made that, you have a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the greatest number of goals is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are spaces of <unk>
We must deal with the implications, and better that we have to deal with now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people have assumed that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is is the <unk>
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and then give you <unk> or another one that will make users of chairs up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also a big force, which is the speed of your speed, and it helps you for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and it can integrate and connect it with the universe and other <unk>
This is not an <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on is about the American soldier who, on average, should take over the American soldier that on average, a 45 pounds, and it's <unk>
Obviously, this leads to some important complications <unk> injury in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge, and create a exoskeleton that I could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds for signs for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
<unk> I want to do, or where I want to go, and then where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner <unk> to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now to the users of chairs walls about what I feel particularly <unk>
There are more million people with the <unk> on the wheels, around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often very young people, very young people, on the spinal cord than when you start their life -- 20, 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheels that it turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population of the population that we multiply very quickly.
His only choice, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been like for the last 500 years, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> that 19 years ago he had a injury in the <unk> <unk> and as a result couldn't walk for 19 years now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It was completely not <unk> in the crutches to send them the computer computer on board, here on the back.
There are also some batteries in the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward to this soft and very natural and very natural <unk>
I was 24 years on the top of my life, at the top of my life when I miss a stranger in the air, on the air, on the air, was <unk>
In a fraction of second, I lost all feeling and all of the <unk> movement down.
Shortly time later, a doctor went to my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole the last bit of my life expectancy for my being.
<unk> technology technology ever allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climb rocks and even <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk with you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations to future generations -- not just by soldiers, but we all of the users of chairs.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is the order to be a serious thing.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, know to his cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> <unk> world in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimpanzees, their living alive.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our human evolution <unk>
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society Bonobo in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where violence is still not yet.
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it has been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a land of the <unk> biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict, which has caused by decades, and caused as many as many deaths as the First World War.
It's surprising that this destruction will also put in danger to the survival.
<unk> meat trade and deforestation do you can't fill in or a stadium with the bonobos that are not able to fill in the world -- and honestly, and honestly, and we are not certain about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter, hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that the apes like the love, not the <unk> not <unk> that have sex -- because they have frequent <unk> and <unk> to deal with social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the <unk> lives more than the <unk>
<unk> as humans, love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and for those of them to play is fundamental to form links to the <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and resilience is to do with the generation of diversity of interactions, diversity of the connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game <unk> <unk> roots and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have a female a female and a young male <unk>
Look what it is to do it.
It could be the origin of the <unk> <unk> it could be <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting -- because <unk> this video really interesting is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements of the game -- like the <unk> and also how game it requires -- and how play it requires trust and <unk> it and at the same time.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female female, which is playing with a <unk> water.
I think, as it -- sometimes we play alone, and we have to explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful that playful that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little little samples from the understanding that Bonobo us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world success to a world that changes have to play.
But let's give it the most <unk> of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For the bonobos the life of the way life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate thing, when it looks at the least appropriate thing to play, you can be the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, to embrace this gift of the evolution and play together together as long as -- creativity, creativity, and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, you get fires like a captain of fire in a fire <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers <unk> a highly skilled staff has to get to the site of the fire very soon <unk>
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability <unk>
But even there was a race on the other volunteers for the captain to get the captain to get the captain to find out what it was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the <unk> that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her <unk> as his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before I said, <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  He came first to put up and <unk> the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of her life, would have to tell the people that in a <unk> building in order to save a live live because of five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go between the house.
I need to be <unk> <unk> and bring it to this woman a pair of <unk>
You get it.
It wasn't exactly what he was waiting for, but he got the stairs, at the end of the hallway he went out to the <unk> <unk> that the way they had ended up and just ended up in the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my <unk> charge on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the main door.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the house of the home where, as he would expect, his trove a lot more attention than me.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the <unk> <unk> by the brave effort to save their house.
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that somebody had achieved a pair of shoes.
Both of my <unk> in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a <unk> I am a witness of generosity acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> but also the <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room for people who have done -- or are in the <unk> <unk> I would like to remind you -- I don't have to remind you this.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference for a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a <unk> <unk>
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we can influence somebody's life.
So they trained the shoe <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, you back. Mark, back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange -- but I'm a great piece of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks of the first concrete blocks have a very simple <unk> modules from a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a fixed measure of a measurement that fit with each other.
Very quickly, these became the world's most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, he came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to all home.
It's estimated that you've made more than 400 billion or 75 billion people on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
He was simply adopted by the concrete block the <unk> in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the '80s, the next revolution was about <unk> the new building block block is to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small little plastic unit that would lead us from a aesthetic brick world of aesthetic bricks for a world where everything was interactive.
So just as the block block block that the concrete block allows you to create much greater and more complex circuits -- a brick at the time.
But there is a <unk> difference, the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, and sound and sensors.
And the best of it is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't be <unk>
They have a <unk>
The green is the <unk> the <unk> is the stream, pink is the <unk> and the orange color is the wire and the orange color.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one and very quickly you can start to make the major circuits.
A blue one blue with a green is produce light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a <unk> <unk> that is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We took this <unk> to create more impact and make it a <unk>
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Rather than having to program, instead of having to program, it allows you to program using <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower and slowly, just spin this button that makes a pulse that makes a pulse <unk>
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a <unk>
We want all interactions in the world to get ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, solar panels, <unk>
We've given <unk> kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a light of night, or why the door of an elevator is remain open, or how an iPod is responding to touch.
We've taken <unk> schools in design.
So for example, designers without experience some electronics that they start playing with <unk> like a material.
You can see here with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that have no experience in engineering, just in wood and wood and paper and said, <unk> and <unk>
Here's an example of a project that have made a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material is to be the rest of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interaction is us.
And so forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment.
<unk> <unk> collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> just for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This isn't ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I will be at time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in a year and work in a environment, almost everything that we are supposed to do with the government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like a <unk> <unk> for <unk>
We have a few members every year and we put them into the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World <unk> we send it to the Third World <unk>
They made great <unk> they worked with <unk> employees to worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
Do you find <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Here it comes as if it would look like a quote, but what is really looking for somebody who is <unk> when you get out of the snow because you know it's not very good at turning fires when it is covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to help this is so <unk> so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time, very much of the last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that <unk> citizens with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made as any good programmer, he developed an app.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you get <unk>
When you do so, you put a name, in this case you <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a mathematical component.
It's a modest application.
It may be the smallest of 21 applications -- the last year.
But it does something that no other technology from the government <unk>
And it spreads viral form.
One responsible for <unk> <unk> to see this application realized that he could use it not for the snow, but for the citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk>
So I asked citizens to be <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use using using it.
And this has spread <unk> of organic and natural <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The acquisition acquisition acquisition of the general <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by the normal <unk> it would have taken at least two years and two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
There is now a project in the judicial power of California that until the time has two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
And so an app that you have in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form a viral form is a kind of a shot by the institution of the government.
It suggests the best of the best ways of work, not as many people think that they should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without <unk> in the open form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way that the heart of government is the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good at the collective action with the digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people that are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration before but they didn't get it <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, it line up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy, the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because alone <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because the things are changing.
The politics not <unk> the government is yes.
And because the government is ultimately <unk> we remember that <unk> the <unk> -- the way of thinking about it will affect change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to get <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is that the government is about everything, a matter of <unk>
This is the phone center of health care and information.
It's the place that calls calls if you just take a <unk>
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> on the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He didn't find anything.
And then he said, "Hey, you can open the house of the house, put it very strong and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston is not a phone center.
He's got a web application, and mobile website, called <unk>
I didn't think that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the State <unk> <unk> <unk> in Boston.
One day, this was really, really come this <unk> <unk> in my cube <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you all can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back the <unk> I went home.
Good evening. sweet <unk> <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income to the voluntary volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition technological definition.
I'm talking about a platform for people to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
He connected two people.
And it could be connected to government services to be necessary but their neighbor is a better choice and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another neighbor is help into the communities.
If we call animals, that costs a lot of money.
One thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the other of the other.
Our input system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is our values and we don't see our needs, but we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense ocean and the politics is <unk>
That's below what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But that's that <unk> which is what it keeps us that we have that we have that we have that we produced as something that we have in our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to have to make the bureaucracy are sexy.
Because it's where the true real labor does.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That does the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that have written a very detailed report <unk> pages in response to the <unk> <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for the ones that we have to <unk> the government, is time for us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the big challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we are going to be where we have to go without solving the institution that can be <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that the technology is possible to rethink the root function of government function so that it can spread to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> you have to articulate the systems of the right shape.
The average age of our members is 28 years so that I, to <unk> -- I'm a generation that I am a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown by taking the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to happen, everyone is going to speak away.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time.
So when they face the government problem doesn't care about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They get hands in the work to program applications that do better the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking off <unk> <unk> dumping you a garbage bucket that has a <unk>
And then, we always could have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are like <unk> digital <unk> we're not only consumers, we're not only the government consumers we pay tax and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of the religious things, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in <unk> prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there are a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here have impact all over the world.
At occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense of a little force and a force I wouldn't have in another way.
I say this because I believe that identity is important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can have a lot of sense, but if you feel with feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been <unk>
His parents were born in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery in the way he saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come to <unk> I was approaching myself, and I said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was <unk> again and if he said yes, I was in peace.
He had this human quality that he would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of 10.
At occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it was not easy time to get your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I woke up in the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
I thought I was a game.
And so I looked at it and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up through the room, she took my hand and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, "Come on.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> will tell you something, but you can't tell you."
I said, "Okay, <unk> <unk>
She said, "Now I was <unk> I said, <unk> <unk> I said, <unk> <unk>
And then she sat down, and looked at me and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do the <unk>
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just want me to <unk> three things, <unk> <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to do is that we always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to say that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I said, "Yes, <unk> I will.
And then he said, "I know the second thing I want me to tell you, is you always are going to be the right thing even though it is the right thing to do.
I thought I said, "Yes, <unk> I said, "Yes, <unk> I will.
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want to tell you, is that never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do."
I grew up in the field, in the <unk> <unk> I have a little older year and sister a smaller year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us and I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us.
We just arrived in the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he took a sip of the beer, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take a <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, and you have always <unk> what you do.
I took something, your sister is <unk> <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can get <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk> Take a <unk>
I went out and look at it with force and <unk> "Oh, it's not going to be you're thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't be to say.
I know that this is <unk>
But I am 52 years, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking to be a <unk> I say it is for the power of the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things about others that they don't really see them.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to be able to do.
I think that my grandmother was naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should be <unk>
Now, I'm going to try to talk about our criminal justice justice system.
This country today is very different than 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the United States.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so despair determined by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or <unk>
In urban <unk> in the entire country, Los Angeles, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all the young men are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth does what the results are.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these aren't problems.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work -- some very curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you get rid of your rights -- if you have a <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the male population of black male has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we show it to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as before they were before the law enforcement enforcement
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country of the world where it's <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have in this prison country for children, without the possibility of a chance of the time.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense of sense, we have been to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not trying to decide whether people deserve to die for the <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death sentence in America is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine nine <unk> has been identified which is innocent and released <unk> of death.
A mistake, <unk> <unk> an innocent <unk>
This is interesting.
By aviation wouldn't allow you to be able to fly airplanes if in every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that I in my classes with students about history <unk>
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot of this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried worried about <unk>
The threat of terror was what they defined their lives.
Now there are people older people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history deal with the <unk> after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
This was the age of terrorism -- I was obviously <unk> and decades of <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what historically, we've done.
All of the time we had to get one another.
We were constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about speech, I think that's because we're not willing to engage with a truth process.
In South Africa, people really understood that you couldn't overcome <unk> of race without a commitment and a reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide they had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany talking about the death row.
It was fascinating because one of the professors who stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good enough to hear what you <unk>
<unk> "Not death row in Germany.
<unk> we will never be able to be here."
The room was in silence and a lady said, "There's no way for our history, we could never get to get into the systematic death systematic human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we started to run people."
So let's think about this.
How do we become a nation where a nation like Germany, <unk> especially if they were in most <unk>
We could not get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things, though.
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, that realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both of these things.
We've talked about the need to have more hope, more of the need to have more the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that it wants to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
And thinking of them it is, in a way, something that's within our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being as rational, so committed to an intellectual <unk>
With innovation, the development is not only about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also through the facts.
So this connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and the <unk> but also the dark thing and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader <unk> talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed to be in terms of despair and be <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is almost in the heart of what I believe, that even in communities as a TED needs to be.
There's no disconnect disconnect with technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty and <unk> to inequality, for injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we know these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet <unk>
These women would just be used to speak.
Occasionally, the lunch lady called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> lady is <unk> we're going to bring us to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I know <unk>
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
And so I was just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. <unk> was headed to me, and he said, "Now, <unk> tell me, "Now, <unk> tell me.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the injustice.
We try to help which have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end the sentences of life, without freedom with hanging out for children.
We try to do something about the death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave my whole <unk> and he looked at me and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> was <unk> I put my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much <unk>
I think that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher at the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone in the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that if you take something that doesn't tell you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And then finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> is not very <unk> we will not judge our technology, or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not in the way as they treat rich, and <unk> it but the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound themes about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
We are tired, tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> <unk>
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and I see my <unk> who have been <unk> for them as adults.
And I start to think, how can be?
How can a judge make someone in what a judge doesn't it?
<unk> <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
One night was a very late night to wake up for God, if the judge can turn you into something which is not something that you are, you should have to have <unk> powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has the magic powers.
You should ask something about that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think of correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 customer a 14 years old, white.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> which said, <unk> for my 14 black <unk> was treated as a white white <unk> a <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I put there that there was been <unk> <unk> in the <unk> behavior.
There was a line <unk> about how in this country there is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For me my horror, not only have <unk> they sent to the cut.
About two months ago, I had forgotten it.
And then I finally <unk> God, I have to go to the court for this case stupid.
I went to the car, and I was really feeling <unk> <unk>
I went to court.
I thought that would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down from the car. He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, she came up with me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he says, "I'm <unk> I said yes.
And so I got <unk> and <unk>
And I would tell you in your ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with me, with my identity with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When you arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk> <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> <unk> and we started acting.
People started to get there.
I was the one who had written those crazy things.
They came the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
As suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and all of us, because talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would just look at the window and hear all that <unk>
You walk up here and walking over here and over here.
Finally, this old old black man was in the room and I went out in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> was <unk> because the <unk> had gone into the room.
The <unk> <unk> about the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> <unk>
And the old black man stood up, he looked at me and he said, <unk> to this audience room <unk> to this room <unk> <unk> this young guy who kept his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think that a lot of you see that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds it away.
We can't be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights, and by dignity.
That our survival is connected to the other of us.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people here who share this, I just want to tell you the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> you can hear and see one apparent desire in the audience of this community, to help something.
Is something a <unk> What can we do? What can we do?
<unk> There are a number of money.
If you live in California, for example, there will be an <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort -- this spring is going to be an effort to <unk> the funding that is to spend today's policy today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death, in the next five billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> in homicide in homicide <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> don't come to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that you would be <unk> these funds to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it comes this dramatic increase in the <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three of three legal causes to lead people to supply the <unk> chain of <unk> by stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against property, rather than that we <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about the punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've excited to be excited today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you so much for you to come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be from the last six months or the last six days.
The idea is that the media media prefer to <unk> negative news, because our minds are paying attention to them.
And that responds to very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as no matter more than to survive, the first stop all of this data is an old old clip of the time called <unk>
The amygdala is <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and records all the whole information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> stories of <unk> look at the negative.
That old saying old saying, "If there is blood, you know, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us news news, like the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, 24
It's not surprising that people think that the world is <unk>
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what happens is that we get <unk>
Maybe enormous progress in the last century that a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance over three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change, the species, and <unk> water and <unk>
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems, and we just have them.
Let's look at what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> income per capita per capita per capita inflation has been <unk> around the world.
infant mortality has been reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, in transportation of transportation and communications, 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles Kyi is that global literacy country 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are about it.
And we continue to get higher expectations.
In fact, we would have the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., most of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water, toilets, <unk> TV, mobile conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the planet would never have dreamed of like <unk>
And so much of this is a lot of technology and recently its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that you <unk> in the information technology technology comes into this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price performance of the price of about 12 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the <unk>
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad -- in good and bad -- in the war and peace, in recession, and <unk>
It's the result of food we used to build it faster faster.
It's not about any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call they call and <unk> sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and the fuel can be personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked in the newspaper in the newspapers the best <unk>
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of your mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can be positively <unk> the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk> absurd.
Today we can point a <unk> of companies that they've already done.
When I think of creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating the <unk> life of the planet, it's about creating a life of what is possible.
It's about taking that it is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that frees resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> story. It's a <unk> story.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to buy the king <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> and <unk> with gold.
But the <unk> King ate with covered <unk> aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, which was more than the gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, although the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the mass of the Earth is not coming as a <unk>
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he came the <unk> and he made the aluminum <unk> which was as cheap as it was <unk>
It was <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the energy shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> by <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT <unk> published a study showing that at the end of the decade, electricity in the United States, electric electricity in the United States, for hour compared to the national average.
And if we have the abundance of energy we also have of water.
Let's talk about the wars on water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out of the Voyager <unk> spaceship on Earth, in 1990, after that.
<unk> a famous photograph. How do you get <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we live in a planet of water.
We live on a planet for a 70 percent water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, the two percent is ice is ice, and we fought for the water of the planet, but also here's hope.
It's a technology that's available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one morning, this morning, one of the innovators I'd like to share with you, for you, the technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the <unk> it's the size of a smaller.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of water to the day of any <unk> <unk> saltwater, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola is thought to make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out all right, and I have full confidence that this is so that it will be, Coca-Cola is the <unk> <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation. This technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to reach to 70 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the midst of Kenya that President Reagan is 25 years ago.
And by counting with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and more information than the President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of information abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have been paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video, books of books and music, and the music of diagnosis is <unk> now and lose market value to cell phones.
Maybe it would get the best thing when it comes to the health of the health.
Last month, I had the pleasure month -- with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the world teams of the world for us to <unk> these technologies into a mobile device with the <unk> and because it has <unk> can be <unk> of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent, and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this <unk> device is a virus of RNA or DNA <unk> <unk> or the first place, avoid the <unk>
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just turned the brand out of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to bring the world of education and to bring the world of education down.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never ever before <unk> that we add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do we <unk> What <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health because of a better education of the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in the cloud of the cloud more productive than never before.
What can you provide about three billion members of mankind, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and they can act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 billion?
And if are they contributions we can't do it.
One thing that I learned with the X <unk> is that small, guided teams by their passion with an objective goal, they can do things <unk> things that are the governments.
I'm going to finish with sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There is a program that maybe some of you have heard about it.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how that protein.
<unk> determine and the structure is <unk>
It's very important for medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They have played with this college professors play with each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came up and started <unk>
And it's shown today that the machinery of human patterns is to be better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power of the world's greatest challenges.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are us to work to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have been in front of a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> the <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> -- but it wasn't like this.
They actually pick up fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk> <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> in the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have any special stuff.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they continue to <unk>
So what about here?
The second story is also illustrates another <unk> the change of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could be <unk>
I burned very much with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not from there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And the fisheries of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
We were going to take the five inches.
It was an genetic pressure.
There was no fish.
They were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing of changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe was done a lot of development.
<unk> development was meant to the countries that they had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> the industrial fisheries.
And this boat, pretty bad <unk> called the <unk> four.
I went to fishing on him, and we did studies in the south of the Sea <unk> and, above all, in the <unk>
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> I know that, at the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny blobs of these tiny remains <unk>
In short, the bottom line came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is quite extraordinary.
In a year, you do a studio and then start the commercial fishing
The background is going to be a very solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living.
I was not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are where they collect the fishermen that they never have fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the way to start to start the starting point at the new level, not to remember what was there.
If you <unk> this happens something like this.
On the axis -- we have biodiversity, we have biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes with time it changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation, using the <unk> images to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and <unk>
The difference is that loss of loss.
But they don't see the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk>
And at the end of the end you keep a few <unk>
And that, in a big deal is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they already are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people in the people when societies in them kill animals not to know what they've done before.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose any animal animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
With the time, we focus on the big animals, and in an synonymous with big fish.
They get <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like captain such as captain as a lot of fish in this area you can't be used -- or usually they don't use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So so we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in our own country sources.
From there the huge role that can be turned out a protected marine <unk>
Because in the marine areas protected we actually <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's very low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area <unk> and can benefit from the vision that you can be <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Middle <unk>
I think that the arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the <unk>
A long time ago, there was gray whales in the <unk> bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think why people were <unk> film, talking about the story of <unk> why do we <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something which, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give up is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in the professional form.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see what videos they do <unk> and what importance of the videos are <unk>
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> -- when I was younger, when I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can make a famous <unk>
They climb over 48 hours on YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of it becomes viral myriad countless visits and cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> <unk> communities shared and factor for surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, oh my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> published this video filmed outside his home in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows shows the <unk> of popular summer.
They didn't talk to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had been published a lot of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> which <unk> the <unk>
<unk> of trends like Jimmy <unk> and we present things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to come up the weekend, the end of a week.   <unk> <unk> at Friday.  <unk> at Friday.  <unk> at Friday.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows shows how often we use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed like there have come out of the nothing.
So what about this day?
Well, it was Friday, really.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this particular Friday <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of <unk> of trends a point of view and share it with a broader audience.
So, this community of people that share this great internal joke then starts to talk about it and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Only in the first seven days, there was a parody for every one of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, in the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being a part of the <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation animation with a <unk> music.
That's so that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that is rare, you know that a <unk> version of three hours has seen four million times.
And so far, cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats seeing the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that I woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone did an version of the old one.
And then it was international <unk>
All of a sudden, the whole community of <unk> that it made this would happen to be an dumb <unk> to something that we can all be a part.
Because it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> <unk> or <unk>
What would do it have written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days you go up two days of video a minute, just just the only unexpected and unexpected thing in the way that these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me I had to see this great video of a guy that <unk> against <unk> in New York City, to admit, in New York City, to admit that I didn't really interested me.
Casey <unk> It was not circular for the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you circular properly from the <unk>
KA: Because of the surprise of surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things that we make in a creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators trend of trend, is completely <unk> are features a new type of media, a new kind of new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't borrow permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media, are just the ones that are the current means -- but <unk> the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life has been supported by the unique hope of unit and their country.
<unk> as the <unk> in <unk> facing the fact that their life had been completely <unk>
The words for so long friends, I'm going to get it.
They <unk> in silence.
He died in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let it have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but <unk>
The next puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 when his father died, and a marriage <unk> and two little girls.
For her, life was destined for a <unk> task to escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
And the greatest fear of <unk> rape and death.
As most adults, my mother had had a <unk> <unk>
And if we were first <unk> I would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, <unk> <unk> in every <unk> and the vast <unk> and a massive <unk>
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not be able to wear for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform to the <unk> coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and she died, and she died, and the first apple that I <unk> given for the men in the platform.
No apple had ever had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four generations across three generations to make a new new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the population is <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells of the stores that came from the rest of the world.
And the English fragments were traded among people among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line, working six days, working six days.
Yet, I found time in time to study English and get a <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, an extra <unk> in English and <unk> that was always <unk> it was always <unk>
Two hundred <unk> for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
I had a school uniform <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we moved on about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother's home.
My mother suffered <unk>
And my task was to be awake until his <unk> they started to be awake until his nightmares could be <unk>
She opened a computer store, then he studied a computer and open other business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry angry <unk> and <unk> boys and <unk> <unk>
They were used and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and isolation.
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was a <unk> young man of the year.
And I went away from a piece of the puzzle to another, but his <unk> <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I never heard to name, and in the house whose existence she'd never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire the routines. And the happy life in a suburb <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, two daughters and two girls as they did it for about 20 years, <unk> on the day of every day and running <unk> on the day in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the boat.
The nothing had been an option.
He said, "You don't be what you're not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly, the more I was <unk> to speak.
I met people of all the roads of life, a lot of them doing what they were living in the border of it.
And even though I ended up my work, I realized I couldn't stay in a career <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized the same time that is well going to be an unknown -- a newly <unk> new in the scene -- and not only it's good, but that's something that will be grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to be the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave them enough steps outside my comfort zone outside my happy comfort zone -- but not the way we fear the world <unk>
<unk> they didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, and there was a <unk> and a mixture of humility and it.
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people for whom the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was a giant <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some <unk> and we open up.
It took the decision to move to the United States.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later there was <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before long, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered to it.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At the age 17 became <unk> whose mother <unk> <unk>
Without your husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and bringing the cause her own, and much more it caused when I won.
You can't make it wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel <unk> when she died, and she died, and <unk> in <unk>
I looked up through the <unk> of the shower and saw it.
I knew I had come <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went back to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around in his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a <unk> came to us and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to get her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why said, "Why is his hand it's hot, and the rest of the body <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Because because of the people and how life we get to us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would be <unk>
The defeat would have very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who would you want to want that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, and I can be <unk> in every <unk> the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast seas that doesn't guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take you and see them <unk>
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> right here today in the fourth or fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed from the time of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians we wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when the great prince prince was in the time, the great prince prince prince -- I had <unk> a bow and a <unk> on the ground out.
We now do the same with <unk>
The conclusion that we have was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of fun <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would tell you this idea of losing the ability to lose and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
I looked like the technology had to allow the magic, not to kill her.
As a girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk> her <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> <unk> was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of pictures, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phone, the luxury and the cameras out of the <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up with this technology world to see how it can use it to create magic, rather than kill her.
I <unk> books from 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad <unk> I saw a <unk> device can be able to connect the readers.
You can know how this book is.
Where are we where we are.
Put the text with the image with the image, the sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do for that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app -- an interactive app <unk>
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...   And so --  says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I come up with a character for a character.
And in many moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in the GPS -- which is coming into the GPS -- which is coming to me.
My little girl who gets excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> but <unk> magic of childhood, all of those ideas that are <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always <unk>
So over here, we have to <unk> the iPad of fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what the <unk>
Another idea that I was an idea that I was a child that was a <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> which I drag up to this magic device is in the <unk>
And this opens up a map.
In all of a fantasy fantasy has always been maps but have been maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain of the book that they are also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian content and in the time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the circuit cameras for millennia, in an old <unk>
So we're bringing them back into a child history in the <unk>
In a story that is about current issues as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not come out into the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and then to collect images of different natural objects.
As I had a lot of <unk> I had a lot of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk> <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this ritual of childhood is that you go out and in a chapter, and <unk> a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter you have to take a picture of a piece of a piece of <unk> and then <unk>
So it is a way of a digital digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
In the midst of connections between magic, the Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we asked, "We have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality, <unk> a <unk> group that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> sound to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and magic and the technology is one to each other.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, and love child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many of the <unk> projects.
And I think, really, the most important thing that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> by a director of the listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a small cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What did you <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the greatest problems that all, or maybe not everybody, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a depth of on and <unk>
Every morning <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I was the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information out to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time in which it needs to be <unk> or any urgency to that style is to look back.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter Twitter <unk>
So every morning, I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I put up my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today, and I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure for helping patients, because it could be used for patients patients stop smoking.
On the other side, it can be <unk> to move the people out of their chairs and develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a <unk>
And <unk> people from their houses, take their blood pressure down, get their doctor, and share with each other, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, come back to the <unk> and to be <unk> by their own <unk> but also help us care about health care, because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the costs of attention costs to <unk>
<unk> techniques that are just simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video.
We all have <unk> controls on the <unk>
Maybe even we have in our phones.
We know that's perfectly where <unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the most closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves life right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website -- and we asked the <unk> you see a <unk> please get <unk> where, and when it is open, that sometimes you open in <unk>
And over 10,000 <unk> <unk> were already in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app to <unk> reality, to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use your cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I wanted to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we need to be <unk>
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us to find and work as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> worldwide.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which shows is still in its place.
Please focus on this and not just improve your health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share with a <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, these are photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was struck with my first digital camera at 15 years.
It was mixed with my <unk> <unk> but it was a little bit different because of using the camera -- the process was in planning to use the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph a photograph with a camera that is the process of the <unk>
For me the photograph I had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction in a very <unk> road <unk>
But it has a turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful <unk> and the common goal to keep the level of the <unk>
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way as photography.
You have to be able to think a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with an idea to capture an idea that is going to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look real <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> <unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end of the end, it is about our way to play the world and how you can perceive it in a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic it's realistic but what we think is that it's realistic.
So I think that's very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of the reality and we put them together to create a choice.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined a certain way you can create something that even seems to be able to create something that still looks like this.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
Is it really in combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like a picture looks like a picture of the things that we don't even see in our everyday life.
But when we combine some very important pictures that are <unk> because otherwise something is wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are combined with the same type of light.
And these two images are made with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make you impossible in the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place which is to find out because you don't really need to put the ideas in your mind.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter knew that I had several months to be <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, even the red <unk> <unk> the <unk> house looks more <unk>
So to make a realistic result of a realistic outcome.
You start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you do a good job when you get the results that you can be very beautiful and very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude of magnitude on the performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves that is new.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It was more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do technology curves <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve in which, let's say, well, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to tell you -- the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you put it for example, some other technology, like transport, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, you would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it is a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation -- as fast as the <unk> <unk> tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move to that rhythm.
There's no <unk> in the history of technological growth that every few years advance of the <unk> of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- to look at these <unk> curves that we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or you turn into a typical <unk> I know like this until something totally different, or something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think that maybe going to happen.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
This line is a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is what that new way is that the world <unk>
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember as a child the future was happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference when people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's what we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
You can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years -- because everything will be so different that we extrapolate what we're doing today.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it could be that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to be talking a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer and to do that.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale is that I want to do this is the time of life on the Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So go back about a half billion years ago when the Earth was a huge rock with a lot of chemicals that would be <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that chemical chemicals make us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that moment, there was a simple version of this, and that is that, at the moment, there was a <unk> oil recipes with all sorts of chemical recipes in the inside.
Some of those blobs of oil drops a particular combination of chemicals that they asked them to incorporate materials from the outside and so the <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a certain sense, those were the most <unk> mobile shapes of those oil.
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a prescription a prescription of chemicals.
And every time <unk> <unk> is a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every drop was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time to incorporate chemical chemicals -- more chemicals and more chemicals -- more chemists and more chemicals are <unk>
They usually lived more and more <unk>
It was a way of life, very simple, and it's a very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these drops <unk>
And somehow, we don't understand very well these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemist called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in the other words, <unk> a system of writing that allowed them to record what was to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that the writing system seems to have remained stable since that we evolved a billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same as <unk>
In fact, every living being being living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did only for <unk> now we can write with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of dust white that I'm trying to hide the <unk> security people.
But <unk> Tom <unk> <unk> has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk>
So if you want a 100 million copies of my personal card have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> would have put it in a virus and would have spread it by the <unk>
What was the next <unk>
And to write DNA is an interesting step.
This made these cells are happy other than a billion years old.
But then then another great step in which things another interesting step in which things get very different -- and it was that these cells started trading and communicate information, forming the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can be <unk>
So for example, we evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin the way to prevent penicillin and to create their little DNA on other bacteria and now there are a lot of <unk> that is because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that it would be communities that, in a certain ways, that they would be communities that in a certain way.
And that <unk> or <unk> together, or whether if a community was very successful -- all the individuals of that community became more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so that, in fact, so that they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community to a DNA chain on a DNA.
The next interesting thing for life took another billion years to get another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities <unk> communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells not alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced levels more interesting levels that cell phone that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk>
The neurons are the devices that they process that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures to understand and transmit information.
Those were brains and nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of an evolutionary time.
So a organism I could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit -- because I knew not just to eat some fruit and get sick the last time it.
That could happen during the life of an organism that had been built up for the life processing structures that had been built out of the evolution processing structures that have been learned for the hundreds of thousands of years.
And so the fact that the nervous system built those structures built that is the evolutionary <unk>
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, if I got a very complicated idea.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> <unk> <unk> in their heads that saves a certain analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated -- we become sound, in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to begin to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
Now we go through periods of periods of <unk> organisms -- our record of record and information processing <unk>
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer -- the video tape -- the video tape -- and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger and faster and able to evolve than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where we had a certain evolution of <unk> in which our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages the story that I told you took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The <unk> language, and so they took less than a million years.
And the <unk> as electronics, it looks like a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name -- something that does that its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the more it changes it.
And I think that's what we looked at in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make the life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs are not possible to be possible by the recent computers.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in the connections.
There are billions of millions.
Instead of that with the <unk> designers of <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and it does something that was before it gets much more and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes that use of methods we don't even understand it.
A particularly interesting, interesting method, I've been using is the evolution of itself.
And then we put into the machine an evolutionary process that the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer computer, you can run a hundred million instructions at the chance?
You could run these instructions of instructions at random, by running all those programs, and take those programs, and what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to just to take a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more about to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, and so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random random sequences who did the <unk>
You get those and <unk> the rest of the rest.
And now we <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a <unk> process, analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> children, that <unk> -- and that the children will make the same programs.
And so we got a new generation of product programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please do the <unk>
<unk> again.
And so some mutations a few mutations <unk>
And it tries again and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that were going absolutely perfect.
They're actually a lot more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to be trying to see how they work.
They are <unk>
But they get the <unk>
In fact, yes, I have the security of the security of the goal -- I have the security of hundreds of thousands of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once I was a 747 in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and pull out a card and say, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that they work together to offer a <unk> flight, don't make you <unk>
We know that engineering processes not very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers for doing different design processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now used those programs to make computers much faster and be able to run these programs that much more rapidly.
I mean, <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster that I think is so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at a moment of analog organisms, when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we're the end of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that is to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough for letting me give enough of my fake <unk> in that.
Before we treat my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We are about the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to get <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know about it.
It's called <unk>
And we talk about 300 of a <unk> <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and that anyone who is to <unk> the first base will not come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three attempts to 10.
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, well, maybe maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is somebody who is 10 <unk> they hit me.
<unk> like the legendary <unk> <unk> the last player of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in running more 400 <unk>
Now <unk> this is my medicine world where I feel much more <unk> or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have <unk> and they are <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place, and now suppose that they live in a remote place, and his family physician has two <unk> <unk> and their family physician is <unk>
But you know something?
She's really improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But what do you ask you to ask you to do this.
What do you believe that you should be the average of a heart surgeon or a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth is that no one in the whole medicine truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows that a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do is yet <unk> the world, and I hate to be perfect <unk>
You would never, ever make you a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical college <unk>
I was a graduate student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> studied until a blood test.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not far from here.
And I learned the whole of memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and <unk> <unk> of every artery that is coming out of the <unk> that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis of a frequent <unk> and the usual <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much as we get more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the doctor of medicine with the impression that if you <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or the closest to the everything, because so I get it out of the <unk>
And it worked for a while, until I met <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto -- in Toronto when they brought to the emergency room service where I worked in the emergency room <unk>
At that point, I was assigned to <unk>
And when the emergency room is going to go to a cardiologist he had to attend that patient.
And he report the <unk> <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides -- what sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions your heart stops to work and, instead of <unk> your blood goes forward, blood goes into your lungs, and that's why there is difficulty breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did that, and I started working in the treatment that <unk>
I gave <unk> medication and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
And I gave him <unk> pills for water, so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes of more indeed.
He sent her home without talking to her <unk>
I didn't get the phone I didn't have the phone and I did what I should have done that I was actually to call my head and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, I would have been able to bring the information <unk>
Maybe I did a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that <unk> care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients not even to touch my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, he didn't have paid attention to a voice in my inside that she said, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, it was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that I was taking care of the nurse, <unk> "Do you believe it's good if you're going to <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to be a complete <unk> "Yeah, I think I will be good."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was he signed up with the <unk> and the ambulance along with the ambulance with her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, in the stomach, had a bad <unk>
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking spot where I was my car to go home. At that moment I did something I don't normally do normally,
It went on the emergency emergency service service in the emergency room of the way home.
And there is another nurse, not that I was that I was taking care of the lady <unk> before, but another three words, those three words that most of the emergency <unk>
Other specialists also fear them, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the <unk> patients.
The three words. You remember you?
"Do you remember the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other other nurse with a total <unk>
They said, "Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
After an hour of coming up at his house, after that I would give him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> they brought into the emergency room with 50 percent of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> he was in intensive care and waiting against hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three or three days it was clear to you.
He had a brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they <unk> what was happening.
And in ninth day, she left to go. The lady <unk> wife, <unk> wife, <unk>
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks later, I was <unk> and I thought for the first time the shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, <unk> without feeling that good healthy shame because you can't be <unk> with your colleagues.
You make it all the peace and you make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It's that it tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure to get the things and made sure that it was not <unk>
And I kept telling those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send him to his house?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake that was so <unk>
Why do I chose <unk>
Little <unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, he opened up the sky and finally came out the sun, and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I do a deal with me where if you <unk> the efforts to be perfect enough to do more mistakes, I would prevent those voices.
And he did.
I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, it was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in a community in Northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, I was a little <unk>
He sent him off penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran the door to the door was still pointing out.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, guard, my head guard, and talk to me with <unk> in his office.
And I made three words, you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
He came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can put them on Google. It's an infection, but it's an infection, but it can cause the height of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, she didn't die.
He was <unk> antibiotics <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I was <unk> and I went back to work, until he came over and over and over and over again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, already 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I sent them home -- I don't think it was a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculation <unk>
It turns out an X-ray X-ray -- but it turned out a colleague of a colleague who was checking the patient who was checking the patient with some sensitivity on the bottom right and called the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
And I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I was <unk>
And I looked at it and when I saw some sensitivity in the lower right right-hand <unk> I called the surgeon.
Both they were operated and they recovered well as well.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and like a lot of colleagues that are <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
They have embarrassed and support.
And here's the problem: If I can't be <unk> and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> which tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that you don't make it all the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll talk about the mistakes of other doctors, but you will not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg is that I would have hard to look at look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two <unk> which is that they make mistakes and the ones that they don't.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that they start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you <unk> of medicine to the people that you make mistakes, you get a safe system.
But that's two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical medical <unk> I've done a personal research study from the first of the paper that I wrote for Toronto -- from the first article that I wrote for Toronto -- from the first article that I wrote for "Star <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where errors happen every single day, where one of 10 drugs <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or in a system where <unk> infections are more and more <unk>
In this country, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The Institute of <unk> <unk> <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
The sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect personal history of the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in your chest, come up with alcohol eyes, and with breath and all of a sudden, and suddenly my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't give them their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we remove all the professionals who are a mistake, well, they would not be no one.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art is already a <unk> saying, "This is my worst <unk> <unk> is my <unk> <unk> to the head of <unk> surgery, "This is my worst.
And their students <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and they started to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> you can say, "Look, you don't make it the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do that.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
Your doctor <unk> is human, you know human, you accept it, you know, they don't feel about their mistakes, but they try to learn from what happened to teach others.
They get their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We would have the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way.
And it works in a medical culture that will recognize that human beings run the system, and when this happens, you make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk>
And I feel a lot of it, but I feel a lot of it for learning something that you can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
You know how much we choose for a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that pick up an average American <unk> are about 70 per day.
It doesn't make a lot of a little research on research for a week to a group of office.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks of these executives and the time to make decisions related to those of these tasks.
They found that on average, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every work involved in a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 12 percent for a time or more of time.
Now think about their choices.
You know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, how many of the <unk>
How do we deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the greatest problems to choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know the answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, just raise your hand just if you want to burn it.
Otherwise when you ask a question, if your answer is positive is positive for a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk>
Thank you.
Being graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> <unk> at least at least in that era was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like to go to a <unk> park.
There was 250 kinds of different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables, vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we got water from the tap.
I loved to go to that shop, but at one occasion, I asked myself why I don't buy nothing?
This is the <unk> of <unk> oil.
They had over 75 classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager -- and I asked him to do well -- this strategy of offering all these <unk> strategy.
He pointed out to me the buses of tourists full of tourists and usually with their cameras.
So we decided to make a little experiment with <unk> this is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different kinds of <unk>
<unk> a post for <unk> right at the store.
We put up with six <unk> or 24 flavors -- different flavors and look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people were stopped when they were <unk> that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here we found the opposite effect.
What they stopped when there was only three percent left to buy <unk>
What they stood when there were six, we saw that 30 percent.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide we don't buy any <unk> we probably have to conserve the <unk> but it turns out that we don't buy the problem <unk> but it turns out that is a problem of choices in <unk>
We decided to do it not to decide, yet.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings point.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement about a million Americans, in between 650 650 plans in this country.
We were interested to see if the number of money available in plans for retirement, for retirement, we <unk> to people to save the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
And we found that the greatest <unk> the number of funds, there was less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, you see that in plans two funds, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as <unk>
And in the plans plans to offer 60 <unk> the rate of participation went to the 50th <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you get more options, even in that case there's negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, as much as the number of options, more people to prevent the actions or investment.
As much as more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts for market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the collective financial decisions.
In the early decade, we've seen three major negative negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely people -- the decision, the <unk> even when this is going on against the self-interest.
They're more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health care.
They are more likely to pick up <unk> even less <unk>
The main reason is that we will look at that gigantic variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> and to choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to pick up four simple techniques that we've got, in a way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, than less than today, than less is more than today, than less than it is more than today, than less is more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decides to cut, get rid of -- get rid of -- you get <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- there will be a better experience in <unk>
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> at 15, watched 10 10 percent in sales.
When the <unk> corporation were <unk> eliminated to <unk> <unk> that less <unk> the <unk> of cats <unk> <unk>
You know that today in average, in average, you have 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, you have a 100,000 products.
But the greatest largest store in the world now is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a type of tomato sauce in tin.
In the financial savings world, I think that one of the best examples that have come out of the best examples that have come out of how better to manage the choices is to have David <unk>
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a insurance account.
Those who really want to have a choice, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that often people say, "I don't know how they <unk>
They're all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those choices.
And if their employees cannot be <unk> they can't do it either.
This afternoon, before we started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience a couple of vacation with the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to get <unk> and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I actually actually even hear more hands.
All right.
You actually had more information in the first <unk> which in the second I can <unk> and say that they thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images were made to be more real.
This brings me to the second technical second problem that is <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences among options, you have to understand the consequences of every option, and the consequences must be feeling very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more at average when it uses 30 percent of credit or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem like real money.
It turns out that it looks more real, it can be a lot more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where a <unk> plan.
And the meeting is that we <unk> exactly how we did a little <unk>
What we added is that we asked the staff to think about the staff who would be in their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put their <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than we can drive more than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway in a row.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> the <unk> exhibit magazine <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to do it.
These are two <unk> <unk>
One is called <unk> and one is <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the right on the right is <unk> but you know anything?
This <unk> <unk> is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something that <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of funding.
I suppose who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
And it turns out that we can drive a lot more information than what we think about it, if just <unk>
We need to increase the complexity complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allow you to <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 <unk> to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that it offers each one.
I have an outer color of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices, four boxes, 56 -- lots of options.
And what do I <unk>
What do you so involved you are.
If you <unk> the default button button to every decision, this indicates you are <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that come from a lot of choices to give you the button over and over and over and over again, and over again.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, you keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order of the information in which the information.
If we start with it, you learn how easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the pick box is not saying nothing about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways, to make us a choice.
We're very excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk>
Just to wrap up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories categories with less <unk>
All these techniques that I presented you were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you to be able to use the <unk> or for the people to the people.
I think that I think the key to getting the best of choice is to be careful to the <unk>
And the more careful choices be in our best choices can be able to be able to do the <unk>
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> years, in Germany -- if you had a writing machine writing was <unk> with government.
And I had to record a piece of text from written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they had a written message with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, which is a lot that would be the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer in any big manufacturer in any big manufacturer -- that would end up with a <unk> yellow dots on each page that you have a little yellow <unk> on each page that you get a pattern and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be a lot of it for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online online we can put together attacks.
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a lot of <unk>
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk> This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk> This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online but they do it for illegal media, using banking <unk> when we buy them money when we buy it in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in a computer.
The secret secret service service ago two months ago -- <unk> account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this tells you about <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong with worse.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of suicide <unk> that we see today in day is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate them to the protests, they motivate them to the <unk>
Groups like Anonymous -- in the last 12 months there have been <unk> in the last 12 months.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do for money, <unk> them like Anonymous that they do for us, and the last group that they do for protest and the last group they're <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
It was the bottom <unk> because of a <unk> <unk> because of a <unk>
They put the security of the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week I asked, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch <unk> I asked one of the Chinese leaders if you <unk> the death of people because of the <unk>
And the response of him was yes.
So how do people cause a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do the <unk>
Well, you need you to have a website <unk> <unk> services like <unk> services like <unk>
Except to <unk> a foreign <unk> authority.
And that was <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the <unk> secret police police police police and during the <unk> they found many papers.
Among those roles was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian tools for the citizens of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 50,000 euros to the Chinese government.
The company <unk> is right here.
That is, Western governments give them tools to government governments to do their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple weeks ago, found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to find their own citizens.
If you are <unk> you in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going more there.
You get the Internet connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all media, and to get our data.
When we think closely about things like these obvious response should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do with it.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play privacy.
privacy.
It's not a question of privacy versus security.
It's about control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right in 2011, any right now.
They <unk> blindly in any government in a administration that could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that should be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the south part of South Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, the back and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences in the <unk> which means that wild animals like <unk> <unk> in the park.
And predators, like lions, <unk> and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and as soon as we were in the morning, and we found it very bad felt because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so the value of it.
So I grew up, <unk> a lot of the lions.
They were all warriors that protect our community and livestock and they are also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions in Nairobi.
I think that's so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at six to the age nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that black lions were afraid.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because even helping the lions see the pen <unk>
Don't <unk> <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick male lions to believe that he was near <unk>
But the lions are very smart --  They came the first day and they were the <unk> but the second day, and they came back and said, this thing doesn't happen, and they said, this thing doesn't always move,  And so they raised and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the torch and the lions didn't come in.
I discovered that male lions are afraid of light that it moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with which it will turn and turn the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> is the electricity cell to the little <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give out of the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is what lions look like when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to the lions to think that I'm walking up with the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never get a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses have the idea.
One of them is about this grandmother.
She had killed many animals on animals and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> you can see the <unk> of these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've been installed in seven home in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, to hurt a whole lot of Kenya, which is <unk> <unk> and it's also using <unk>
Thanks to this invention, I had the fortune to get a scholarship to get a grant in the top of Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even led to my friends community and installed lights in the homes that they don't have them and teach them how to do it.
So a year ago, it was just a child in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see planes and he said one day in one.
And here I am. I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer in aviation and pilot when it <unk>
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows in my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention -- I want to do one near electric power, one near <unk>
<unk> I know that the <unk> <unk> but I want to do the mine.
CA: You know, you just put it at a time, again, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I got a <unk> <unk>  CA: At the foot, Richard <unk>
We're going to <unk> in every step that I get my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
I grew up singing a song called "Not <unk>
And I felt so proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of Kim South Korean -- Japan is enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the rest of the world, I thought I would happen my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed from a suddenly.
When I was seven years, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and myself was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague, my sister.
I said, "When you <unk> this, the five family members of the family stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We're looking at them together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time that I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little while, when I was walking in front of the train, and I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in the street, looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about them and their families.
A huge famine came to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine -- and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more and more and more of the energy cuts all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights of sea in China, barely across the river since my house.
I always wondered why they had light and not.
This is a satellite picture is a satellite picture from North Korea compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, he saw bodies floating on the river, river
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can just say that during the years of famine -- I was sent to China to live with <unk>
But I just thought I would be separated from my family at the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like life.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but dangerous, because North North China was considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear of my identity outside of my identity -- and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare -- my worst nightmare was actually when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had been accused for me to be <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language.
I was <unk>
I thought that my heart was <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought that my life was <unk>
But I managed to control my emotions and <unk>
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North North Africa in China is <unk> <unk>
But many of you can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though the had <unk> they eventually released after a long international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to <unk> many other North Koreans have not had so lucky.
It's tragedy that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all your world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to suggest the South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much larger challenge.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different from <unk>
It even went through a identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? I am?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with a pride that I could call with a pride that I could call with me.
Even though I went to life in South Korea that was not easy, made a plan. I started to study for the exam to college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities some of the northern money that I sent to my family, and, as blame my family was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in some way, for over 3,000 miles across China, and then over Southeast Asia.
The trip in <unk> took a week, and we almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the <unk> and he asked them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, he thought my family to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up with my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the <unk> <unk>
But I had to spend almost a lot of my money to bribe the <unk> <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I made everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison in the South Korea.
I would come and come between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay for more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North <unk>
I was <unk> with all my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping the <unk> <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The <unk> kind of <unk> a new hope for me and the <unk> people when it was more <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of strangers, and the support of the international community are really the rays in hope that the people need to need it.
With the time, after the long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they went to a new country, they start with or some money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, educational language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because so many of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've been a lot of aid and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive in international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Africa, including the whole TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South <unk>
This is <unk> Center <unk> food, rapid food, <unk> <unk>
And so the city planners come together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Center for it represents something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles in the South, as if this is really wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk> <unk> <unk> food, <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of Americans, live in a food desert -- Los Angeles Center home from the home places to take and eat in the car.
The curious point is that the places of food to take more people in the food in the car.
People are dying from heart disease, in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older that, say, Beverly <unk>
I would tell me what this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to food, and if every time they come out of home you see the <unk> effects that food system in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes of <unk> and buy an apple that has no pesticide have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> which we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x three of me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do the thing that come me in wins, because that's my responsibility and I have to be <unk>
So it was like that to keep it going.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we started planting our forest and we started planting our forest food, <unk> <unk>
What we do -- we are a kind of a group paid for gardeners of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything that we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city is me on top and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my <unk> the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on in it?
A court order to plant food in a piece of land is a piece of land that nobody else --  And so I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
The Times was written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members of Green <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's 68 kilometers of <unk>
That's 20 to 20 <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why does the hell don't look like this?
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, it grows your own food.
<unk> your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up in there.
I was <unk> to be part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I develop my art.
Such an artist <unk> that <unk> walls, and I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the <unk> land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and trees are my <unk>
You get to see what the Earth can be done. If you leave it is their canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing how amazing it is to be a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became a <unk> tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the land.
You get rid of how it affects your kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act of <unk> and thought that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one time, which came a mother and her daughter, they were like the <unk> and they were like the <unk> and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, man, I felt bad ones that were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people get to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to get her <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a refuge in the middle of Los Angeles.
They were guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this had been affected and how they used to plant with their mom and her grandmother, and it was a fabulous way to see how it changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, as about 50 people who are coming from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If the kids grow up, they will eat <unk>
If you raise some tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if you don't teach them how food is affecting your mind and body, they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're <unk> I see the color kids who are in this way designed for them, which is not to take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to be sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You may be able to get the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will do that.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant everything one block block where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and convert them into <unk>
Not <unk>
I'm not talking about free stuff, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, you have to be <unk>
And what I'm talking about is to work people, to get the kids on the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor of growing their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, do we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take them out of your <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk to some <unk> to talk to some <unk>
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant it.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> of the <unk>  I'm probably all agree with me in which this is a very <unk> road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as today, as it is in which it rains, a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that you <unk>
And especially if you're going <unk> in your bicycle <unk> and these cars go not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a road road <unk>
The solution for that is to make the highway of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has the pores and the water can go through it, so that the whole water is easy to drive, and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water is never to drive, water and <unk>
The noise also disappear.
Because it's very open, all the <unk> all the <unk> and so it's a very silent road.
It also has a disadvantages, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can be <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the <unk> the <unk>
First stone one, then a little bit more and more and more and so on, and so forth, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more harm.
Sometimes they can connect bumps with it.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage on this material.
It is a asphalt <unk> as I said, so that only has a little bit of <unk> between the stones.
Because of the <unk> light <unk> -- this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and they would separate from the <unk>
So if you're driving the road, you take the <unk> you look like it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use steel <unk> that for clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits on the <unk>
So we have asphalt <unk> <unk> little pieces of steel in it.
And then you need a machine, like which you see here, that you use to make a <unk> a <unk> machine <unk>
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt <unk> the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks will flow by the surface.
Today, I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring a <unk> machine here here.
The microwave <unk> is a <unk> system.
I put the sample that now I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the <unk>
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, you actually saw our results, and they actually saw that it's very interesting. We have to be <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of road, 400 meters of road, 400 meters of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there, and you see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road is <unk> and then, of course, this road for several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test it in the lab.
We did aging as the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to prove it to it.
We can repeat that many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we have done a material using steel fibers these fibers, to increase the life of the road, to actually increase the lives of the road, to actually increase the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity that it worked.
We still have the sample here.
You actually have to cool cool first before I can show you how you can show them.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC listening to the BBC <unk>
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in these days, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban was <unk> <unk> <unk>
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father really, really happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school said.
One morning I never forget.
A high school.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban <unk> of Afghanistan and they made that girls to be school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who couldn't be used out of outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we made a different route so that nobody could suspect of where you are <unk>
We had to hide the books on top of the market so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, the school suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and they <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of an remote province in Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, was to school and for that her father was <unk>
But my educated mother became mastery.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home school for girls and women and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to get education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risk of the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there was moments when I was very frustrated for our life and I was always scared and couldn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything that you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can give you your house for a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, which is a thing that is here and what is here and if you have to sell our blood to pay for your education to pay for your blood to pay for your blood to pay for your blood to pay for your blood to pay for your blood to pay for your blood to pay for your blood to
So you still want to <unk>
I'm 22 years today.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed for decades.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the <unk> and if my family would have been so committed with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself so proud to graduate in <unk>
When I went back Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was the <unk> of her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He wasn't just about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, but also the first woman, and I'm the first woman that I've been driving with the streets of Kabul.
My family thinks in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even more great dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
It's why we <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong desire to take the chance.
And I see his parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite them, despite and even in front of a <unk> opposition as well.
As a <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went off from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a <unk>
And when you get to your house -- it's the phone, a voice -- you had a voice that if you still have his daughter to school, it would try.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but I wouldn't harm the future of my daughter for old <unk>
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that it's often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter, and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often these are the first compelling <unk> the bright future of your daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
At the <unk> girls who went to school they count in <unk> remember, remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans look at the fragility of the changes.
I'm afraid that these changes don't <unk> much, much after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and his parents that <unk> the <unk> I see the <unk> I see a lasting future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day girls to <unk> me.
Like me, <unk>
Thank you.
never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
It was almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution.
A <unk> forces with a lot of other citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of <unk> and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men -- they were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, the regime, <unk> <unk> and social justice.
You've shown a bravery courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> Middle East, until the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and some losses of about 50 thousand dead <unk> we managed to liberate our country and <unk>
However, <unk> I left with a heavy heavy <unk> legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have loved with a lot of other women, <unk> the civil society -- <unk> a inclusive transition to democracy and a national reconciliation to democracy and the national reconciliation and national reconciliation are.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after that every <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back into Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about development development and leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by the right of <unk> engaging in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
With time, our initiative was <unk>
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in 52 years.
However, recently the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day we were in violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news news of murder and the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Another day we wake up with the news law of law enforcement enforcement <unk>
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their Indus <unk> human rights <unk> and their lack of law.
Our society made a <unk> mindset of a <unk> mindset more, and have been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, that we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all today to be <unk> with our history of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, choosing worse, take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize it.
Because the choices not brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation company.
No, they didn't work.
What happened then?
Why do our society continue <unk> and dominated policy policies of domination and <unk>
Perhaps what was missing wasn't just women, but women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating a consensus more than they needed the election, that only <unk> and <unk>
Our nation needs of the feminine representation of the feminine <unk> of the <unk>
We need to stop acting as privacy agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not just <unk> but put it in practice and actually put the mercy rather than the <unk> of the competition, the power instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately desperately with the order to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to set that in a existential way before it actually <unk>
According to a <unk> from the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> is the <unk> <unk> that spans the whole humanity of the men and women, that all tribes and all the villages that all of the villages and all the villages have <unk>
And so the same as the uterus is completely covers the <unk> that grows in the inside, the <unk> <unk> of compassion -- all of us all existence.
And so he says, "My <unk> brush all the things."
So we told us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That everybody would tell you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a <unk> question, which is an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question that I'm going to deal with is that they all <unk> why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that is to count.
I was 22 years old.
I had moved me to New York City for my first job as a writer and <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, I believed in a lot of times, the man, which I believed was my soul, <unk> <unk> with <unk>
The man, the man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> trap <unk> <unk> where you fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look at a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies <unk> <unk> between them Johnson <unk> Johnson <unk> and The Washington Washington <unk>
I've almost 20 years married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that the domestic violence may happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the religions,
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse or domestic abuse relationships -- or a long duration of the families, the last place where we would be or said, in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find out of the domestic abuse which, the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be told with a man that <unk> and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24 years, have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over other ages, and over 500 women are killed every year and <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold <unk> <unk>
I was sitting on my side in the New York in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first was that he had had a <unk> university <unk> <unk> and who worked on a very important bank of the Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that it seemed like a field of the field.
He had a lot of big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and he seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> <unk> was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the <unk>
He did it especially in the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started to go out and loved all of me -- that I was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, that I had been passionate about helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood and dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as he had ever done before.
And it was why the <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York City and leave my work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices by your spouse, so that I quit my job and I quit my job and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in an idea that was falling in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here's where you come in the scene <unk>
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was the <unk> of the car.
And he kept under the pillow on our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to cause the trauma to come from small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never been a message for me, and even though I had been seriously <unk> for every minute of every day.
The first physical attack was five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I put my girlfriend suit from my neck and married him.
In spite of what had happened, I sure was sure that we were living happily that because I loved it, and he wanted a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> by the wedding, and by making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would make any harm.
I spent twice the top of the honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret a secret to a secret and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> several times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving the moon of honey was <unk> by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac Mac on the face.
<unk> he kept <unk> and two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is the victim of domestic violence or anywhere in their life, and the Disease Control Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that I could help you <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: "Why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the most sad question, and I was the most painful question, because we, by us, because we, we know something that you know, is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of domestic violence in domestic violence occur after the victim of domestic violence, after <unk> because then <unk> it has nothing to lose.
Other consequences include permanent <unk> even after that <unk> has become married, and manipulation of the <unk> has become married, and manipulation of the food justice system to support the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges to spend time to spend their mother.
And yet we continue to ask what is just not <unk>
I was able to <unk> because of one last <unk> beat up my denial.
I realized that the man I loved that he loved he so he would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told everybody, to the police, to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family and <unk> and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to protect the victims of the victims of <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people, it's a way to some people that's a way to say, <unk> is by <unk> as if the victims <unk> their <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened and that we have to promote their lives joyful lives as <unk> wives and mothers, lives out of violence -- like mine.
Because it turns out, I am a really typical victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I got married with a <unk> man, and I was <unk> with a <unk> man.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have more, ever again, is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to my head of someone who says I will.
At this point, they are just thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people, who are the ones who are listening to me right right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, his sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end the end to the end of my particular love <unk> <unk>
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse is only in silence.
They have the power end of domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need to all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
We <unk> the abuse of light talking about it with their kids, their friends, their friends, their family and friends.
We would have a vision of the survivors as fantastic and <unk> that they have a <unk> future.
We would <unk> the actual signs of violence to intervene consciously, <unk> to slow down their climb and to show the victims a safe.
And together together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed up in the room like that.  Fortunately, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing in a <unk> and so you have a lot of luck in your mind, I think.
If some of the women <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but then figure out later on Twitter.
I also want to point that I have the privilege of being able to change what they think about just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These two-inch heel. They are very <unk> less than I don't have to.
The worst part is going to pass this sweater out of your head, because it's when you're going to laugh for me, so you don't do anything while you're <unk>
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, there was never had a real life in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer I was telling me that we would <unk> the back and that he told me that he was going to get my kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> as the one that I made two days ago for the work, you have very little that we can do to transform our respect, and the <unk> and <unk> it has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means will be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman, because I'm a sexy woman, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get a role model to be a role model?
I always discovered, <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're asking what this is <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we not only defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience now to be <unk> and maybe some people in the audience that are now <unk> and there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told every single one of the models at the University of New York -- <unk> -- just less than four percent, was not white.
The next question people always ask me is: Can we be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take it from that.
But then, what I really would tell each of you about one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon and the <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the <unk>
If after this spectacular <unk> <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or the American executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model that is like to be a model that is when you be older.
It's about your control, it's amazing, and it's just a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because of the difference surgery, you can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have to get your studies, and you have a few jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, is to be president of the United States, no matter what you might want to be president of the United States, but you would be able to have <unk> <unk>
The next question people always ask me is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first photo I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know that we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at next to my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party <unk> a few days before the photos <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not myself at those pictures.
They're creations of a professional team, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of his <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> and get this.
Well, the next question people always ask me is to make a lot of things for free?
I have too many a two-inch heel. And I have never been able to use, except the <unk> but the privilege that I get in the real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I was a store and I forgot to take money, and gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I traveled with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> came up with a red <unk> and of course, <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> of these privilege in my way, not what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price to be paying for whatever they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of <unk> teenagers who stood and <unk> 86 percent black were <unk> and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York City, so that for them, it's not a matter of me, <unk>
But how many times I got <unk> and <unk>
When I research to research this talk, I found out that for 53 percent of the <unk> 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure it up to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How do the life of a role model <unk>
And I think the answer to you is that if you're a little bit more <unk> and you have a little bit more <unk> and you have a little bit more <unk> and I feel very happy and happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe so much.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing power to work with creative people, clever people, clever people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras -- what I never said in front of -- is, I am a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every single day.
And if you ever ask you a little more <unk> legs and more <unk> legs and <unk>
They have to meet with a bunch of models, because they have the <unk> legs, the brighter hair and the <unk> and the <unk> but probably become more insecure of the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of race and gender and gender when I'm one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that hold out of this talk, I hope that all of you more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was most enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures, but I didn't know the <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum amount of lighting.
In fact, most of them took shot tourists to random.
My story begins when I was <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife holding me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk>
It gave the chance that we came back to New York City a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I came up with the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why not lead to <unk> in New York at a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
Here is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to have a picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is as universal.
No one has no one has been denied and, fortunately, nobody has ever <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This is a picture of a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a lot of concrete or concrete and a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop time in a October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution and evolution and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope to all the year.
Recently, in one of the travel, one of the <unk> we were walking, when they suddenly stopped on the dry and signal a red <unk> of the toy store that little little on <unk>
And I described what there was to five years of foot at that same place.
<unk> I remembered that I remembered the heart of <unk> with force to see that place for the first time.
And now what you see in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we created are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively being able to engage the conscious of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in a lot of many of the family.
I'm always getting the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all in the picture, and I don't want to encourage you all to get on the picture, and ask you a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 bird species in the world.
The <unk> are in the most <unk> <unk>
First of all, why do they have such bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughter and the <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, it and <unk> these are the attributes that are associated with <unk> Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
Don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean the environment --  <unk> not help prevent disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're away from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of New World who are primarily in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> World <unk> where we have 16 species of extinction.
So, why are the <unk>
They're our <unk> of natural trash <unk>
<unk> the carcasses to bone.
They help kill all the bacteria they help absorb the <unk> which is not being used by them, and cause great losses to livestock and other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there is no <unk> the cadavers there are three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the <unk> symbol of <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and below Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god was <unk> and his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> culture, you get a very important thing to open open sky in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so that these <unk> provide a system of natural <unk> system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six is <unk> <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, are the victims of this.
In Southern Asia, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of <unk> and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall from livestock consumption consumption that has been treated with <unk>
This drug has been banned for <unk> in India and taken a stance.
Since there's no <unk> there have been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge <unk> of time bomb, the number of anger that <unk> enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the greatest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do do this to the birds.
They are <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to figure out its basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see they travel for different countries, so focus on a problem locally and focus on a problem.
We have to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we <unk>
How can you help? Can you become assets, doing noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you that we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors of their neighbors at the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed because it had no effort, no energy spending energy spending of the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything that I <unk> my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work for my life in Africa.
<unk> to <unk> <unk> young man, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that the <unk> that we were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all that, all the things that we <unk> it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few of Italians we decided to teach people in country to grow food.
So we got seeds and seed seeds -- this absolutely magnificent valley that drops to the <unk> River, and we teach the local growing tomatoes to develop tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they <unk> them to come to work, and sometimes they <unk> them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that not just said, "Thank God that we are here --  we just said, "Thank God that we are here."
And of course, everything in Africa is grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> in Italy, a <unk>
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> -- "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> red on the night morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we have no agriculture here."
I thought that only we have the Italians who did errors in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they did the English -- what the <unk> what they did, and then see what the <unk> sat pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste <unk> people from Africa.
You want to read a book, read a book, read a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was in 2009.
We, the Western donors have given the African two million dollars in the last 50 million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage than that money has <unk>
They just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we treat people only two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the whites in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, the little book is <unk> <unk> by <unk> who said for all of the economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first of help.
The first of the aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a <unk> on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to have the 27 years answering people, and invented a system called the <unk> <unk> where you have never come to anybody, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> the <unk> of the local <unk>
So what do you do? They <unk> <unk>
It will never come to a community with an idea, and sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a coffee bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important.
And then, we help you find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of coming to a community to tell people what to do, why don't not, for once, at once.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never be in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what they want to do with their own money, what they want to do with their own money.
So planning is about planning on the blind.
The smartest people of your community, you don't even know the them, because they don't even know the good public meetings.
What do we do? We worked one to one, and we have to make a face a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new business.
The profession is the family doctor of the business, the family family of the business, which is that you on your house, on your kitchen table in your coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a form of a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city <unk>
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on march, and the government came to see to see what you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk> and <unk>  So --  -- so --  -- so --  So -- so --   So we've done 300 things.
We've started to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs dying dying of a loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most <unk> of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before Peter <unk> and this is what Peter <unk> is saying Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company.
<unk> is the kiss of the corporate spirit.
So now it's <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you <unk> <unk> it has to be fantastic <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What do you hear you most of you -- more this morning.
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm saying is that the spirit of an entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the industrial revolution <unk> fossils -- we are at the end of another, we have systems that are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The <unk> as a form of <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
You don't have the technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government? <unk>
They will be entrepreneurs and they are doing right now.
There's an amazing story in a for-profit magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the year <unk> this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City is not that there was a hundred years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is still growing this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million <unk> and the manure was produced by six million <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this <unk> technology that <unk> New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, and what happens? In the United States was <unk> companies.
The idea of finding a different technology is absolutely absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- in <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they will be not going to talk with you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk> service <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company you have to be able to do three <unk> <unk> the product you want to sell to be a fantastic <unk> you have to be a fantastic marketing -- you have to tell you a fantastic marketing and you have to count a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell the money to alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at and see the 100 companies <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- all the new companies -- Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have common -- only one: no one was started by one person.
Not the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when they started.
No one starts alone. Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a little <unk> environment in <unk> <unk> with their dedicated business environment -- who will do you for you, what someone did this gentleman made about this <unk> <unk> guy who asked you, what will take? What do you need?
What can you do? Can you do that? You can do it?
Well, you can be <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> that you look at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> people can help us from a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so I don't make a lot of knowledge for a lot of knowledge despite the same time.
Over the last years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much people pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask for more things without calling up to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for the cows stores so that our communities can reflect today.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love in New <unk>
My soul is always a relief with the giant <unk> which give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It is always going to be the music.  There's a <unk> in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most beautiful <unk>
I live around this house and thought about this home and thought of how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood as well.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this made me a profound gratitude for the time to live and a profound gratitude for the time.
He gave the significant things significant things about my life.
But I want you to keep this looking at my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let me be able to get catch up for the day and I'll forget what it is important to one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> I painted on a giant <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait about this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> <unk>  Before I die -- I want to sit <unk> in the line of change <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before they die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I die I want to tell you a little more."
Before I die I want to go to <unk>
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This space space has been <unk> and the dreams and hope for people to get me laughing and <unk> and they gave me <unk>
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways new and <unk> it's about giving rise to the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and we change.
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of hundreds of messages from passionate people that they wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center, we did a kit. And now the walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Australia, and indeed, and beyond.
And together, we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age that it was more important than ever, to ever find the ways to keep the ways to conserve and remember that life is short and <unk>
The death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death -- it's one of those things that are more power.
And if you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope and fears and stories, people around us, cannot only help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I would like to introduce my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, and it's very hot.
I don't talk but it is <unk> better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what the love.
This is <unk> it will happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about the religious differences and notice in this never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to tell me the word I don't even know that I could even remember one thing: the little thing that we have to be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's <unk> It's very hot.
It will be the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year I stole my <unk> but remember when I was four years old, I can pee in my arm in my arm during the first episode in the first episode and the Lady <unk> <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit the concept of <unk> the society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my soul and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case that was the case that even if it was the case, although it would just consider it in the <unk> that were <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, being diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders in the world, and it's one of the development in the world, there's no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years ago when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new be in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> <unk>
I didn't want to play like the other other babies and, in fact, didn't seem very interested in myself.
I was living and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room around the room, and eat the washing machine and eat anything in the <unk>
As I grew up, it would come more and more and more the differences they become more evident.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and frustration and the <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, a pure nature, a child who watched the world without <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments where I wish that they were like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and the love, and I realize that they're things I wouldn't want to change for the normal.
The bad passes through the beauty of the differences give us the difference and the fact that it's different than any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what is right.
If I could have a single thing to <unk> and I used a single thing you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, <unk> or not, the differences that <unk> are a gift -- each of us who has a gift -- in their inner and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity to <unk> progress and change in the moment where we try to be as well.
<unk> don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, experienced a little bit what he must have been to be <unk> in the country.
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher who gave me an engineering teacher to give an engineering teacher.
I was scared.  <unk> indeed.
But in the developing those conversations, I felt what I would have had to have felt when he was going to have felt when she fell down the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt that I felt when I had those conversations with the students I really surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted them to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our engineers and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges and care of the health, among each other, and if we don't know what we do -- the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that the science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to be <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant for us.
Don't tell us simply to study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat it.
And when you're describing your science, care about the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same thing that make them dumb for dumb things.
Instead, as Einstein said, Einstein who is as simple as possible, that everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
You can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies. They are ways to <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you ever wondered what they're called <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's being supported by the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that the special design of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the <unk> design.
The trick here is to use a simple simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you provide graphics that to our other senses, and you create a deeper sense of understanding what you are <unk>
I think these are just some key who can help the others open the door and look at the country of wonders that's science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all of the media, <unk>  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the American English <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor at the 19th century that a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one that is looking for public <unk> for no matter at the <unk> platform, and then a <unk> and that, when he won, it was by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation in politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that they were going on in the camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name <unk> who faced the <unk>
They brought him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough time facing them, and in the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first <unk> use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as <unk>
Most people think it's true.
It's not. It's for a freedom of freedom of the freedom of it.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to really go back to the U.S., right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call a <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> George <unk> <unk> George <unk> <unk> George <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen by King <unk>
And I could have <unk>
All the world <unk> <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The English House didn't want Washington to stop power.
They didn't want to call it King for if he was giving him or her <unk>
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> <unk> title, and the more <unk> <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> and government, but it was a <unk> degree.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take serious about a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite until I've been able to figure out the Senate never <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama are lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep going on waiting for <unk> to <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and I want to tell you that the President of President of America is not just so modest today, right?
Everything if you get more of 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air vehicles is not <unk> and so on.
The reality and the story has taken the <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got his <unk> <unk>
And also the other concern the Senate, <unk> appearance -- well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell you that it's now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that is the great lesson that I would like to be <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but really, really change the words that what they might change the reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under land in an illegal mine.
The air is <unk> and the air is <unk> and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies that in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear you voices that talk but, above all, that <unk> of male <unk> and stones <unk> <unk>
Like the others, I carry this kind of cheap light -- <unk> <unk> with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of branches that you hold the walls of that hole in a meter in the ground.
He was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> who lost control and fell meters in the <unk>
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep way of that hole at their life without paying reward, and often they dying.
I went from that hole and I went home and went home but maybe never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures, native cultures in six continents and 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that takes to eradicate modern slavery.
So we started talking about slavery and, really, started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not at such a grade.
When we ended up talking very wrong, I honestly was honestly <unk> I was really <unk> I was to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> <unk> and weeks later, he flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
This is how my journey started modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few times you even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are currently more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of the <unk> of the entire slave slaves are <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave <unk> a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> <unk> the equivalent of the <unk>
And yet, today, we can make all of the entire families by <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates over <unk> 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
A lot of people have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then find that they're forced to work without pay, of violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the agricultural goods -- they have value, but those who produce are disposable them.
<unk> exists almost all the world and yet illegal in the world.
In India, I met the bricks.
This strange <unk> and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> on an temperature of 54 C, women, kids, in fact, full families -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanically <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over and over 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, and they had not <unk> to eat, and the severe <unk> it made that pee quite a lot of <unk>
So <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera was too warm and the dust that my camera was too warm on the way to work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car for clean the team and make it work with air conditioning -- and make it work with air conditioning -- and, sitting there, like, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was very quickly told by me, and he said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And I explained very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't afford any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put it in a worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and complained that it is.
As soon to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
And in the Himalayas, he found children carrying <unk> rocks for <unk> <unk> <unk>
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children and the <unk> them to their head with their heads with their head with <unk> strings and <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been a whole life.
They have nothing with the <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, they <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, I think it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> <unk> women had been previously <unk> sex.
I took a few <unk> <unk> that by a few <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, local prostitution for <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms -- where we <unk> them with their girls and kids, some of them just seven years -- are forced to <unk> clients and <unk> alcohol.
Every place is dark and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer suffer from sexual <unk>
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> and in that minute, I can imagine what it should be going to stay in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs I just had a <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big windows to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a topic so hard, it's important to point that slavery even the sex traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in the domestic service service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times recently reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children killed every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> is another activity that we often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were whole family <unk> in the trade.
This is a family.
The black <unk> <unk> are the <unk> the blue ones and the blue <unk>
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still can't be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It is estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake on the lake -- the largest lake in the world.
And when we arrived, I was going to take a look at a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a ship, two older brothers -- some younger kids, some young kids.
<unk> They were all <unk>
Kids are separated from their <unk> families, and they were forced to work on <unk> <unk> these boats on the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with was <unk> it was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of branches of trees on the <unk> lake often will catch and fear, and <unk> and children, and fear, the water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since <unk> always was forced to work on the lake.
For fear that I love it is not going to flee and, like the whole life of <unk> and like all life that has been treated with <unk> <unk> it is to the younger <unk>
I met these guys five in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the <unk>
At the cold night and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by the fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes it.
Who will come to be because of somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
He <unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners, the <unk> a <unk> <unk> with his <unk> and played the window.
It asked us to do it by a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car out of the car, and asked the driver to go back quickly.
And then he pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started down, we take away the <unk> we would take the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the <unk> and so I put the photos of photos on my head as a chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs together, and they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well of another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the <unk> they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember I looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells up to 90 meters and these people are wearing heavy stone bags that then will be <unk> to another area which is to be able to extract the gold so that the gold so you can get the gold.
So in the first sight, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look at the closer you look at the margin -- the margin we see a little less lucky ones.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends like this victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
And when his uncle, <unk> inherit his uncle from the uncle to be a slave debt to the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in which the doctors would say it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and <unk> and, nevertheless, it's forced to work on night and day on that mine.
And yet, he dream of being liberated and educated with aid activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a distant possibility that is that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light out of slavery.
Did you know that your images would be <unk> for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony to them, and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then so hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These are these images are not <unk> they're people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I happen to think about these so many beautiful, beautiful people, I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images is a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out a fire and that <unk> <unk> light on the slavery is, because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the management <unk>
No one knows what the hell do.
So I'm going to try and try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll be further ahead.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably some initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's skill can gradually be this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous <unk>
In the last few years, it has been really progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and you have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective and ultimately the only way we know if there really is a cure when we have an objective or an objective when we have an objective to be when we have an objective <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the movement there is not <unk> -- so they don't use blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic for the clinic.
You wouldn't need staff.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
And so what I want to do is to you as a way of <unk> not a <unk> form -- you can see it in a certain sense, all of us -- <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the vowels.
It shows someone healthy as long as sounds, and we can imagine as a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those genital <unk> organs to produce sounds, and we all have the <unk> for example.
And like <unk> it requires an extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time that takes a child to learn to it.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal vocal cords as well as Parkinson's as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk>
At the bottom of the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of the vowels.
We see the same <unk>
shake it and <unk>
The speech is more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole range of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also <unk> scores are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds of a lot.
They're at minimum cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost that <unk> it appears to be a <unk>
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties of patients.
I wouldn't do need to go to the clinic for the <unk> for routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get in the <unk>
We could make a <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the <unk> first of the disease before it is too late.
So by giving you the first early steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for a billion people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> can call a <unk> and let me get a few cents. And let me <unk> you -- that we have reached eight percent of the goal in the only eight hours.
Thanks.
What are these <unk>
Max <unk> Yes, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You can see some people not <unk> Can you not <unk>
But we're going to get a very large sample of data <unk> in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion of the disease.
TR: They have a <unk> accuracy in this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to be <unk> has made a fantastic job, and now it's shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what you will do -- the project. Now we have an <unk>
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of March 2011, I was <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We <unk> in the dark, in rooms and without windows and <unk> and we avoid sunlight.
We make models we still get more <unk> the perfect skin -- we make the impossible perfect <unk> even more perfect -- we make it the whole press, all of the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of a lot of experience with a lot of a real happy picture.
On March 11 March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world -- events that was going on in Japan.
Shortly time later, an organization where I was <unk> <unk> was in the place working as a part of the answer.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay in the house, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small <unk> village in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first <unk>
The water level of the <unk> reached over 24 feet and over three miles of land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
It will be rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> remove the slime mold and left the <unk> houses to be <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory factory.
We were <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> photos and <unk> photos and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
Let's take them and bring them to different places of the peoples of all around us.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
While <unk> <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the village.
It helped clean the <unk> <unk> the huge <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the people in the city where the center of <unk> would take the photos.
And they had the honor and had the honor of that day and had the honor of that day out.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression and thought beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until <unk> myself as my something that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some who had over a hundred years -- they were still in the lab, and I couldn't stop thinking like how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and knew hundreds of people that they could do the same thing.
So that night I came up with some of them, and the next morning, and the next morning, was so overwhelming and positive and that knew that we had to try.
So we started to <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl that I had to get to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would never have the side of her, and that would be as tragic as she was a picture of her <unk>
With the step of the time, they became kind of more pictures, and they needed more <unk> so he entered Facebook and five days later five days later, 80 days later, 80 days later to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people who had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, in July, to <unk> a town neighbor of the <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the psychological libraries that had been <unk> where people would be to reclaim their photos.
The time <unk> time is a different story, is a different story: <unk> of course, from the photos.
It could make it for an hour. I could make it for a weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw in practically using as a guide by using the areas that the color and detail the water was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> <unk> <unk> with algae -- with algae -- with algae -- with algae all over the time with the time I continue to <unk> it was a major part of the project.
We could not tinker with the picture unless they were <unk> and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to hand.
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more of the <unk>
As a <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman that brought us these photos these photos had been kind of a relationship to the photos.
I had begun to <unk> it itself but he stopped the <unk> even more.
I had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and their own face would have been able to have been able to get the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked their pictures that they shared a little bit of their story.
A few colleagues of his husband found the photographs in a fire station between the rubble that he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the walls to the wave, the <unk>
He had to go inside the water while <unk>
His little kids -- not so small now, but their two children were in school in the different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find her entire family and knowing that they all survived.
The day I handed his photographs his younger son was at 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could come back to look at, something that would remember the past day -- something that I could remember the past day when everything in his life changed a <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined us to <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up more than 50,000 photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds and hundreds and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them for them.
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a picture of somebody or something, one of a <unk> or something, a <unk>
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us but the first thing we would look at it.
This was the project of restore the little tiny little bits of humanity, from the past.
When a picture of a picture like this is to tell someone a huge difference in the person's life.
This project also made a great difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them with something connected them with something larger, using it to their talent to do something that they will not be models thin with perfect skin.
And I would like to read this email to <unk> email to the end of it, and I sent him back in Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the <unk>
One particular one in particular, a photo with women in different ages from the young girl to the small girl, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family -- and a similar picture of my family my mother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter.
In the whole world, in the whole world, in all the very few our basic needs -- right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired and curiosity that inspired this picture of a bullet that was taken through an apple in a picture of a millionth of a millionth of a <unk>
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion billion, but to see a billion frames a second.
And I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique as fast that it can create a lot of rapid video that it can create in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can look after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X, and the <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and I turned it and put it in a <unk> <unk> in a second or a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that package <unk> that <unk> travel to travel the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet in a regular bullet than a common bullet was a million times.
If we take that bullet and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, that all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light on movement.
Coca-Cola doesn't <unk> this research.  <unk> -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package which starts to <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes at the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble bubble in the inside.
At the time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the bottle, the one you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, which all of the bits that all are <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make a little bit of the same distance and we see it the same distance and we see it in a <unk> camera about 10 billion times, how much they think that would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? A week?
It would be a very boring film, of a slow bullet of motion.
And what about what about <unk> nature.
You can see the waves <unk> of the <unk> of the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I was thinking, a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full full problems.
But if you look at a more time this tomato <unk> you'll realize that, as the light <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces off inside their inside and back and back and forth after several <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if your fruit is grown up, and have you <unk>
What do we create this camera at <unk>
As 1950, you know, if you take a <unk> it goes into a <unk>
But we're going to go and go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition -- so you can actually go into some light.
We <unk> that <unk> that package is <unk> billion times, and we recorded one and over and over and with a very <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of these raw data, and we can make it interesting.
Superman can be fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door.
And we could get these multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. It's already built.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk>
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons to go back to the camera but interestingly, very different times.
And as we have a camera that works as fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good time <unk> and you can look at the world at the speed of the light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is a distance.
By projecting a laser -- you can record a picture in <unk> which, you see on the screen, really no sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of the images, and we will try to look at all the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
We can see it in <unk>
This is our <unk>
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> with what is on the <unk>
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue, and the blood is really hard, so that this is a really difficult for scientists to start thinking about the <unk> as a new <unk> environment, to solve the problems of <unk> health in the next generation.
So like <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it became the science in art, an art of <unk> pictures.
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collected every single data that we collected every time is not just for scientific accounts.
We create a new form of computational photography with slow <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember, time between each of those waves of those waves is from just a few <unk>
But here's a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves underneath the <unk> these will go from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strangers. Right? At Einstein would have strangers.
The order of the events in the world the events in the world on the time on the camera.
We can <unk> the corresponding space of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can change your life, and give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone -- a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, a <unk> a <unk> a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, <unk> and make it famous.
This is all possible for a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this moment to this city.
So here you can see the hundreds of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people <unk> who all these people who are <unk> and they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who is a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everyone today.
But today I'm talking about me today about my phone, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission in the E.U.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every human phone company, every single Internet provider from the entire Internet, has to store a wide range of information information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or your <unk>
And in all Europe people <unk> and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone and Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you see about 10 thousand people who came to the streets streets and said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some of you even said that this would be <unk>
The <unk> was the secret Germany of East <unk>
And I also asked if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, so please give me all the information that you had about me.
And I asked one time, and I went back to ask me and I didn't get the <unk> and I didn't get a particular answer.
But then I said, "I want to have this information, because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give it a judicial demand because because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of you, you know.
They <unk> the demand and they would send me the information I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed for the German law enforcement of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty hundred and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
I saw at the beginning, and I said, well, it's a massive file.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, "I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show you people what the retention <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open it down City, we did this.
This is a six months of six months of my life.
You can go and go back and go back and go back and go ahead.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on train to <unk> and how often I call the path.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they're called between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one on the other, and we ended up with this big communications network.
You can see how their people are communicates with each other and what time they call each other to their hour.
You can see all this.
You can see the <unk> leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model for your society, because you know who's talking to whom, who's sent an email to whom, this is all possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and for two years.
As I said in the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, I had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who were never happened.
The fall of the Berlin <unk> maybe never had happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and business companies want to store as much information from us as being possible in the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to be <unk> for the time.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home tell their friends to tell their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century.
When they go home, tell their representative to their representative and tell their representative that only because companies and state agencies can store it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company ask -- what do you store of you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones using your mobile phones on the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi <unk> <unk>
It's not enough.
Hi <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me the world.
<unk> to my mom six times six different directions -- we <unk> the poor of me.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so I <unk> all the time.

It's <unk> I am like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus in my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, because they are.
It only happens for accidents, as the one that I came up with birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not <unk> I am an inspiration. I don't want any one of the ones that I don't want any of them.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, have I wish to be a <unk>
Let's take a ride.
<unk> Christmas <unk> are in the shopping center in the shopping spaces and what do you know?
16 empty empty <unk>
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and it's just one of them.
There is a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> <unk> and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might be able to do it.
I'm from Park in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three big older sisters I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would come to the school and <unk> that I was also <unk> that I was also outside -- and if you didn't get the ultimate note.
My father taught me to walk at the age five years putting my <unk> and just walking.
Another <unk> I used to be just a dollar in front of a dollar in front of it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the children's kindergarten kindergarten was a <unk> <unk> which has received many taps.
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arab and still being all of the family.  I think that no one of the <unk> that we weren't really <unk>
This was before September 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up not had trouble my faith.
However, it seemed like a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months to live three <unk> <unk> so that the dawn of dawn is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  <unk> -- my parents couldn't pay physical therapy, so they sent to the dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk>
And when my friends was going to happen in the summer of summer at the coast of Jersey, I was not coming.
I was all my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we won't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get us in <unk>
On the summer of the summer often my father trying to be <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> me in the back, <unk> and I was <unk> in the back, <unk> and I remember the water <unk> and I was like, <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in my head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that any dream that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to <unk>
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of the Arizona, because in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
Everyone <unk>
I did all of the <unk> tasks I did all the <unk> I took the ultimate note.
Every time I was a scene from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> <unk> in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started shouting at four <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of <unk> I <unk>
Thank God <unk> in order I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk>
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater, <unk> historically, as if anybody had killed my cat, ask me why and she told me why and she told me that because he could do the stunts of risk.
And I said, "Excuse me, <unk> if I can't do the stunts is also not the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave it to a actress <unk> <unk>
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with no disabled actors <unk>
And I graduated home, and I went home and my first <unk> <unk> was as extra as a <unk> <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I sat there as a <unk> <unk> not even more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with disability.
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women who had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
And in my first tour, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> New York in New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he landed at the high speed at the highway in New Jersey that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs entire United States, and also in Arabic, in Arabic, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find ourselves very fun.
In 2003, my other mom from another mother, father, Dean <unk> and I launched and we launched the <unk> <unk> New York City <unk>
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media media and the media to remind the time directors that <unk> and Arabic <unk> aren't <unk>
<unk> to the Arab was much easier to fight against the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited when he was invited to <unk> it has Keith <unk>
I walked as if it was to be a graduate dance to graduate school, and I went to a studio and <unk>
I looked at the <unk> and said, "Excuse me, "Excuse me, you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and he said, <unk> four, three, four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I taped myself at the desk in the <unk> <unk> to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> knew that they wouldn't come back.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like <unk> and <unk> my chair.
Something a funny thing I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are told that children are <unk> but they never get away from me and <unk>
Suddenly, my Internet disability became <unk>
I would see video clips online, "Why do I <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> <unk>
What does this disease have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> <unk> suggested I would have to write my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The disability is as visual as a race.
If anyone in a wheelchair can't do the <unk> then they can't make anybody in <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk>
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk>
The doctors would say not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, to have grown media media, I don't believe that it was <unk>
I hope that together we could create more positive images in the media and everyday life.
Maybe if there would have more positive images, I have less hate the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we all need society to teach our kids.
My tortuous journey has led me very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> world is <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> in terms of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk>
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children refugee <unk> to Palestinians unless I was some of my parents.
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a young village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small village in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
The <unk> the <unk> the small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
No one for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When there comes there, there is no opportunities when there is no work, no work of the future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year we had nothing.
One day you get a guy who gives him a <unk> he offered him after dinner, after dinner, to <unk>
<unk> a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money for a little bit of money to send it home for new family to send their family.
Let me introduce you to a young man.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
So a beautiful beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> <unk>
That little boy that small village dreams in the great city was the terrorist terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> an organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little child in a small village trying to fulfill his dreams in the city with him.
He was waiting.
I was waiting for a chance, waiting time to start his future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing they arrived.
This was the first thing he pulled him from what we call the <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the <unk> of work, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people that live in cities they will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of the <unk> to violence, <unk> will be the story of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young men.
70 percent don't work to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital was <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen it forced me to be at that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month that month was actually to harbor some youth leaders at a city.
<unk> to about 90 leaders, youth leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me that because he was a graduate college that was the frustrated, <unk> was the perfect white white <unk> was the perfect <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the greatest obstacle to come from point A to the point A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way.
<unk> he saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> directly to the local residents who typically couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and their dream is at some point to hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is a different story?
What do this story different?
I think that their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit -- and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> to young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for.
And you can train young people to be <unk>
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my <unk> Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture.
In fact, this is the first <unk> which has seen in over 22 years, and until very recently, until he came, if you wanted flowers -- if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic <unk>
If I got to somebody, "When was the last time you saw the last time <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is to be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> <unk> <unk>
I created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> which said, "You could survive the hard climate <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding gardens to create gardens of houses, and business businesses -- and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in <unk>
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and, like it, say, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because of a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, work for the government, but their history, their innovation, had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
<unk> to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
They are business solutions for local problems.
So, when we inspire young people to create a business <unk> culture, it's really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need experience and guidance to guide them into the development of their business.
<unk> to young people with the resources resources that they need, the support they need to go through the creation of creation, and create an <unk>
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His <unk> that's how they call it when it's called, when it is to transform the way people see their city.
They hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> to keep the <unk> for him.
They gave them the chance to escape <unk> <unk>
These young men are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, and my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains <unk> a <unk> area Northern New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and not being on the road that we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square meters with <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> paper balls.
And I was <unk> incredibly angry and incredibly <unk> <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to get what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and I got a little bit of a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the clean <unk> of our trash, and it is about 11 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to figure out as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel like the uniform and <unk> that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through the <unk> and I interviewed people in office office and facilities a lot, but was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working like <unk> <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And we <unk> the mechanical mechanical <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe it, and it is not as strong as you think it's very strong.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working in it for several years and their bodies continued to get their bodies to get over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> the waste of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering traffic all the whole day and move all the day and move all the day around.
They just want to be <unk> so often the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And the trash is also full of dangers that often is full of dangers that often came out of the truck.
I also learned about the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature in the nature of the truck, you know.
It never leaves come.
It's also like a breathing way of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems that the stigma is particularly ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> is the most important labor of the city streets for three reasons.
They are the first surge of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste way of waste and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> out of your container and their dangers and anticipate inherent in very real ways.
As we were controlled for decades and centuries and <unk>
The economics needs.
If we can't get rid of the old old thing that we have in space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when is in danger.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointed its relationship.
And then what I call our average average speed is necessary.
So with that, I mean, just at the speed that we used to move through the <unk>
We usually don't get <unk> or <unk> and we have our cup of coffee, our bag of the <unk> of our water.
We we forget the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side of it.
So today that I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to figure out about the collection of waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma stigma and <unk> that conversation about how to design a sustainable city.
Their work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use in a lot of cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to make ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us sure about ourselves, the flow of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always because of a way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001 -- I heard the <unk> of a waste truck on the street, grabbed my little little son, and I went back and there was a man doing his <unk> and he had a man doing his <unk> journey of paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for his job at the particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's be okay.
Let's be right."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate waste collection and <unk>
It's called <unk> we work so many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that it was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our <unk> <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have at account all the costs, even the cost human cost of the labor.
The city waste is what we think when we talk about trash <unk> it represents three percent of the entire <unk>
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and your life, the next thing you see somebody whose work whose work is to clean the trash of you, just a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focused on the connection of thinking about our life of community life forming a part of the environment where architecture is born in the local conditions.
I brought two recent projects I brought two recent projects.
Both of these projects are located in Ethiopia -- one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial design center, in the Addis <unk> capital of Ethiopia,
This is the kind of construction that you showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings buildings there are a lot in the city we realized that there are three important aspects of the city.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because of the <unk> of heat causes heat into the <unk> so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it's about the climate in which it's about about 25 degrees above the entire year.
And thirdly, its nothing that looks like Africa has nothing to do with Africa or with Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really <unk> with the old <unk> structure -- where thousands of people, where thousands of people, and they buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
And so I thought, that this was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern <unk> a number of stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge, the next challenge is that the site, which is located in a far growth zone in the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, not exist.
And it's between two parallel parallel parallel in the <unk>
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, and we put all the entries in the building.
And this spreads with an <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the open air in the building in the shape of the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor of the space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric of the concrete <unk> <unk> <unk> to allow the air to air, and also a <unk>
We then inspire these beautiful buttons of the <unk> <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and it helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows and the light of a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of color crystals that uses light from the inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't mean easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of market would be much more profitable than the commercial center is because of the end of the commercial for the end of it because they were more <unk>
And then the idea of the facade was a much more economic <unk> not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary for <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels on the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create the <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, <unk> and the <unk>
It waits for the early year, because we go for the fifth year of construction.
The second example is a <unk> of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project, a bigger project, which I have to do is not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> -- a thousand years old <unk> that was surrounded by a wall with 12 <unk> of access to <unk>
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the existing streets by creating 12 initial blocks of size, and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose a few <unk> points in the relationship with straight lines, and that altered the initial model.
And the last operation was thinking about the cell, the small cell in the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best amount of orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and so a natural <unk>
So we <unk> a scheme that <unk> that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the <unk>
And also it responds to local norms to local norms and the lower density of the lower levels and a lower density.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community the space occupied by building the building for the construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can you go up and make activities like a <unk> and make such a <unk> which is a two miles per morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in emergent countries, where you can see the cities in literally growing up.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's architecture changes the same pace and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to the architecture to look for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and the goal of connecting nature to nature.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came into our class. It was as remarkable, as they see all the new <unk>
He had great amounts of hair very brilliant and a little <unk> little <unk> <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my <unk> plan.
One day I was a day after a day after the <unk> I was a little bit later and <unk> in the <unk> of girls.
And when the coast was <unk> salt, I entered in the classroom, took the classroom, took on the table of my teacher to graduate the <unk>
And then I did.
I would take the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All like this.  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row in <unk> and just to be there, and so on.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well about doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I was never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I will never get me.
But above all, I was the reason why I was because that <unk> so small, so small, so good.
I was <unk> <unk>
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. They birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one number one <unk> in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> <unk> or long duration or sadness.
So because of that, you have to go in the fiction, because art is like the lab in which <unk> in all of its ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> to be literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I would have no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
And they would take the lists out of the high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as much as the <unk> almost all of them.
This year you get 100 years of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the most <unk> <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, everything that we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the <unk> <unk> right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget what they are.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said was as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious that the <unk> that you get to the person, they reduce their wish, they are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
To be at the time <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details do to <unk>
<unk> make us all the <unk> <unk> and that's something that I <unk>
Everything that she does for me to give me pleasure could be pleasure at the other time.
And it starts to say that story, in the same story, and since then, <unk> says that every <unk> cool thing is that it turns out in its lover -- it adds up to his <unk> <unk> <unk> in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it an <unk> <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great <unk> and the cute little hair and small <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of the photos.
That's why <unk> <unk> is so successful --  <unk> links the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is on its <unk> <unk> <unk> listening to the gates and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- so <unk> those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or to look at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see them <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're looking for knowledge, and really hard to do it, the most painful truth, and the most painful truth of the truth.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who is who we need to do -- causes us to think about us a range of feelings that we need much more profound feelings and vital than a man who can be <unk>
We are telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> us will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way?
There is some other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity as <unk>
Freud to write about it later.
One day, Freud went visited by a young young young woman who was being used with the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, which is something weird that he didn't get his wife.
And she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing it.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels, the novels, how do we <unk> us to look at intensity but accurately.
In fact, the more brightly we are, we the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, lead us to make violent acts of <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about eight years old, <unk> it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years was captured by having created a false note on Facebook from the one that you would send <unk> messages that I themselves, awful himself for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to get <unk> to the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, reacted with awe.
Because, let's be realistic.
How long -- does it creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange character in American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are the books that are trying to deal with how the language, copy our minds and the <unk> that separates which is what it might be, can be <unk> in an instant.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> or want what you have to take you to take you and <unk> you from what you ever <unk> and it's under the <unk> <unk> your name, <unk> <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the rest of the world, both as well as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face <unk> the head face <unk> <unk> you need <unk> <unk> it needs the <unk>
Oh, <unk> <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the <unk>
But as they work together, something starts to change, and then finally in "The <unk> of the six <unk> <unk> once you <unk> it and says, <unk> is <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you there is no one person in <unk> <unk> who doesn't want to <unk> the hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history, it seems to me very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems like <unk> as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
So the next minute you are the same side.
All of a sudden <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so <unk>
What if the <unk> are really a issue of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to the another?
Well, maybe we don't have to make the excellence of each other.
We can be <unk> with it.
But I like <unk> <unk>
So as we hope that this happens, we remember that we have the fiction.
Only fiction <unk>
The fiction used <unk> on the table.
And look at what was the sweet <unk> the <unk> the terrifying -- Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> the very Marcel <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of July 1969, she had jumped out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Armstrong and <unk> <unk> but his presence in the gray surface of the <unk> was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program, was the largest rise of peace history.
To reach the moon, NASA took about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave for about 400,000 million people who were working 400,000 people in 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People were killed, including the Apollo crew one.
But before the Apollo Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over on his surface, from which I had been behind Armstrong death, last year, is the most <unk> <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
So why do we <unk> the cynical answer is that they were because the president was because the <unk> that this nation was <unk>
But the own words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> <unk> -- some ask, "Why do you <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why will climb the most <unk> <unk>
35 years ago, why fly about the <unk>
Why do I play Rice <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're very simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> <unk> was not just a victory of the West at the end of this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the powers of technology.
It was because it was great because it was great power.
The landing landing came up in a context of a long <unk> list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and was eliminated by smallpox.
Technology seemed like the technology that Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a ship with candle, but in 1969, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo Apollo <unk>
Since 1970, no human being has become the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo Apollo <unk> 10, and the optimism of the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagine that the technology would solve technology as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, to the global population of the <unk>
I remember the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't have to <unk> <unk> <unk> the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew what this would be would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So as you look at it, it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard that all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists had found ourselves and <unk> with trivial toys -- things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have <unk> our lives.
But not <unk> the great deal of humanity.
What happened?
There is an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> which have been created that have been created less ambitious to <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are all the guilty, in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists are offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by the creation of <unk> ideas to <unk> or even false trouble.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were on their high point without worrying about risk, they rather than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies as energy, which they need to be a massive capital and developing technology is long-term in the long term. You've also never invested in the development development development development technologies that you need to solve great problems, because you don't have a <unk> value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and deep and deep and in deep and more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we do not solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we can go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would take a political decision that is popular and that's never going to happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are things more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't fix the big problems, because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy as solar and solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic for the two percent.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar energy and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of energy that they can compete in price.
Now, technologists, technologists, economists and economists agree about what policies and international deals with <unk> the development of the energy development, <unk> a significant increase in research, and some kind of control of the price of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of the current political policy -- or international deals with that consensus. consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed like the technology that seemed like a lot of them to be.
We know for a long time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are <unk> policies that affect the food distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage of food, but there will be <unk> and there will be a lot of governments.
Finally, the big problems that we have to do with a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon was given the war by cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some <unk> some <unk> and only in the last 10 years that they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can -- but these four elements we have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population needs to want to solve the problem, and the institutions must be really <unk> it must be a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, is it with those <unk>
But it's a model model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is not a <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy -- which is the difficult thing, and there is not a popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out.
I was just three days.
And I really wasn't even <unk>
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about confidence, the trust, and I'm going to start <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first is a <unk> there has been a huge decline of trust, is a very generic reality.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the confidence.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you about a different story today is a different story about a <unk> and a task, and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I <unk> to think that there may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased others.
I don't have that.
But I can focus on <unk> polls and polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at your opinion polls over time, there is not a lot of evidence.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, journalists and political journalists still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable people that were still quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen is almost exactly half of the road.
But it's evidence to enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, views.
What else can you do <unk>
What you're looking at are the generic attitudes that people live when they do certain questions.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if anybody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> at <unk> <unk>
I probably would say, "What is for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you said -- you say, "Well, I trust you in some, but I trust some no."
What is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to create the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence we are going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or a person, it's going to be uniform in all of these cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust in a certain teacher who I know in a certain teacher who I know to give the classroom, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could rely on my most <unk> friend I could trust a conversation, but no, maybe to keep it a secret.
Simple.
And if we had those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave the whole knowledge of that knowledge when we think about confidence.
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence <unk> and they try to <unk> the good judgment in something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the <unk>
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I <unk> to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
And ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings have called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think -- well, yes, it was too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> and <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, it says, yes, that means that it says that what matters in the first of not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to make a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is competent in commodities.
But yes, on the contrary, aren't <unk> you couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but they didn't get a letter to the email, because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is like this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> <unk> before confidence.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be?
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems <unk> for all sorts of people, professional people, all sorts of people, and so forth, that make us easier the task to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as a <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, let's tell you the problem is it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> to go in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we <unk> that the <unk> system that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> it's actually doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of people who have to make hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> as we say.
You've probably all know some examples of the similar examples.
And we <unk> all of that, on the target.
I think that the goal I should be more <unk> and the goal I should be more <unk> and the things would be different from being worthy of confidence and <unk> it to the people that we are safe and if you stop if other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's really not easy. It's really not easy. It's the simple actions, it doesn't do properly.
Third, task.
<unk> to rebuild the <unk> of trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do that if they're two people, trying to improve the confidence.
But the trust, ultimately, is <unk> because they give us some other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't be <unk> because of all people, all the time.
But you also have to contribute to <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is a daily everywhere, and it does all the common people, the <unk> of the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks and he says that I can <unk> without giving up.
I took me and get it out of the money, or get me into the color of the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust you you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So at the end, I believe that what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person and the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> and more and more, at the point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask you, and if I had no <unk>
I started to imagine how it <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that you get into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> on the screen is its physical body <unk>
designers can get their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice a virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool break down the barriers.
But both of the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Sciences Science <unk> with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard on a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent <unk> with cameras to detect the fingers and face, now you get the hands of the keyboard, which is to get inside of the 3D space, and grab the pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, it's so easy as to grab a book of <unk>
You can look through the book and <unk> or <unk> or words with the virtual <unk> that the virtual <unk> the virtual screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information to us?
And so many of us would have a lot of we would have bought and run things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device put up in your head of a device on your head, and you get the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make physicists so that we can be physicists so we can be physical.
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my Harvard Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This imam <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> we did what we did was the gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release the constraints of time and space, it means that human movements can be <unk> and go to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can be <unk> and you can physically be <unk> and the famous <unk> by Michael Jordan can play it as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use as a tool to understand complicated concepts as the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike monitors books, or the text, this is a real experience and feel that it is powerful.
But what is more fascinating that to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not just show you something but will begin to act directly about us as a part of the physical world around us without that we have to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if we make that barrier, the only limit that's our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes to athletes all <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like this.
After surviving the Industrial Revolution, they create firmly that there was just a way that was effective toward <unk> and very <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary <unk>
An opera singer has starting to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could go to go to the opera school.
And so I wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio program.
But at any adult any adult you get the idea.
No adult me was serious.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, as I am.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to find another <unk>
No one to me, <unk> Okay. Okay.
It was <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books on here?
Those who were in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> tries to <unk> Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but <unk>
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave place my <unk> habit of <unk>
<unk> lots of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map was a piece of place, because this is what students are the students in China.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be at the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are research and research fields like religion and <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a topic.
And I thought that if comparative reading work worked for research, why not do it also in life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be from <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual and spiritual and <unk>
For the Buddha, you are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people the past and present.
I know I'm not going back to feel like or powerless to be <unk>
Having a dream to <unk> really is nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where the happiness.
Even a dream <unk> can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here today, happy today that I'm here, happy to live again with purpose and clarity, with clarity, and most clearly, with purpose.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first <unk>
I was a graduate student in psychology in psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw in the couch and taken away from my office took off the shoes and told me that he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I played a <unk> which I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could deal with it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought together to the <unk> it became easy to just move the head as long as the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> was the new <unk> said and so that I was right.
You start to work after a house later, then they got children later, and then death happens later.
To <unk> like Alex and I had time for <unk>
But shortly later, my <unk> <unk> I pushed me to press this <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, is coming out with the guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> she said, "No no, but maybe it was <unk>
Also, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people feel their head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex would be the perfect moment we were in it.
And so I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and it had real, not just for Alex and his loving life, not only for Alex and his loving life, and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that no one to the age of age without spending before by the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They are amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love one <unk> you would take a <unk> -- I want you to see it -- it's okay.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the keys in life are going to be 35 years old.
This means eight percent of every 10 and experiences and moments of <unk> moments that give you shape your life will have happened to have 30 and <unk>
People from <unk> I stopped panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that you <unk>
We know that more than half the Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> meaning that if there's something that you want to change yourself, now is the time to change it.
We know that personality. It changes more times during your <unk> than anywhere else in life and we know that the female fertility comes to the top to the 28 and the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> on their body and their choices.
When we think of development as a child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment when its everyday life and common has an impact on the person that is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called the adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> they're listening.
<unk> talk about changes on the line of time of <unk>
The researchers call <unk> a <unk>
<unk> tells you <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
<unk> Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think about when you give you a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their <unk> and absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, interesting things like you or their children and they say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this <unk> is not good for me, but this relationship.
Or they say, "Everybody says that as a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better figured out the day that I graduated.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They all run and <unk> but then at some time around the 30, it went off the music and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who will be left stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest <unk> chair.
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little <unk> but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the 30 percent, and so many of you start a career, pick a city, choosing a city, and have two or three children in a period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show, which is much harder and really hard to do everything at the <unk>
The middle-aged age crisis is not about buying red <unk>
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want right now.
<unk> realize you can't have the son you want to now, or you can't give you a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and a lot of <unk> you see themselves, and they talk about the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was he thinking?" What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was <unk> What was
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By the 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a identity crisis, having a identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but it was still not to decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, it was cheaper to have a boyfriend, which shows more <unk>
And despite living with a very difficult life of the previous life that was even more difficult.
They are often in our <unk> but then he was getting up the same as to say, "You don't choose your family, but it can pick up your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his head of his legs and cried during almost the time.
I had just buy a new book book just to <unk> and had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then she was watching the empty space that follows after the <unk> <unk> that he was following <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care if she gives you <unk>
At that time, it took a lot at that time, it took a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which was really a <unk> which was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his chance.
I had learned a lot of a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in Alex as the <unk> of Emma happening.
So, for the next weeks, I told Emma three things and months, deserves three things to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that the <unk> of identity and <unk> capital of identity.
For capital capital I mean to do something that add value to your individual.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: What do I know about it: capital identity creates identity.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to make it out.
I'm not walking through exploration, and I'm <unk> the exploration -- I shouldn't count, by the way, is not exploration, which, by the way, is not exploration, which, by the way, is <unk>
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that <unk> and I told Emma jobs and to do it.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that you come together with friends with a similar minds look at how much to who you know what you know how you think and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person to get out almost always comes from their nearest closest circle.
The new things come from what they are called the weak bonds friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> they have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs created never <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
And so, but not least, Emma believed that you you don't choose your family, but I know to your friends.
This was true when he was growing, but as <unk> Emma soon to his family, when she has a partner and shaped his own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family to pick up his family there was the time.
Maybe you think that 30 is better time to sit on mind that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live in a living right now or <unk> you now when all on Facebook begin is progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before it was before it, and that involves being as intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to make it work or kill you time with anyone who is to get them to get them to you.
So what about <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> <unk> a cousin who was working on a art museum in the other state.
This weak link helped him to get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with that he alive.
Five years later, five years later, it's special <unk>
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and send me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of any emergency lines are not good enough.
<unk> story may sound sound easy, but that's what I love with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplane that they come out from the <unk> airport that go somewhere in the west <unk>
Just before the <unk> a light <unk> in its trajectory is the difference between the ground makes the difference between <unk>
In the same way, to the age or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good time, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next years or even the next generation.
Here's my idea worth of spreading all the <unk> who have heard about it.
It's as simple as what I learned to Alex.
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> <unk> like Emma all the <unk> -- they're not the new <unk> <unk> his <unk> get capital capital capital -- use your family capital -- they choose to your family.
They won't be allowed to define what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job of management <unk> for a job that was even more <unk>
I went to teach teaching students mathematics students at the public public schools.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I work I went back, I was grades.
What I called was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance did not have <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things that you need to learn in seventh of seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and was very convinced that every one of my students I could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for the time.
After several years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if succeed in school and life depends much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college and become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults all sorts of adults all sorts of <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training.
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and tried to predict what children <unk> as far as the competition.
We studied <unk> <unk> working in the very difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are even teaching at the end of the year school and <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, asking people to do <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of these different contexts emerged from all these very different contexts, as an important <unk>
And it was not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires questionnaires and then waited about over a year to see the people who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly more likely to <unk> even when they were able to get them to measure, things like family income, the <unk> things like family income, and even the security that they felt the children when they were in school.
So not only in West <unk> or the <unk> National <unk> where <unk> matters is also in school, especially for children at risk.
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know the science about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do development in the children?
What should I do to teach the kids a very hard work ethic.
How do I keep keeping them motivated the <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent to <unk>
Our data data, clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly not related or even related to the <unk> measures.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about develop the determination of children is something called <unk> from growth."
This is an idea developed at the Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not as much of the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read them and learn about the brain and how it changes the challenge, and how you change it, because you don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to be <unk>
We need to measure if they've been a <unk> and we need to be willing to fail, and we have to start everything again to the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain of our kids to be more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories -- one of my most <unk> memories -- the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was <unk> by this incredible language.
But for a foreign position, it seems to be as <unk> as Great <unk> as the Great <unk>
In the last few years, I've been asking me if I can break down this <unk> so that whatever it is to be to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the strokes on the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, is better than we do it in a faster and simple form.
A Chinese academic, about 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 200 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read the traffic signs of traffic menus, <unk> to understand the basic idea of <unk>
Today I start with eight to eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you can even be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person that's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if he was screaming <unk> -- <unk> -- I am <unk> -- this is a symbol of the <unk> but I like to believe that it's the other way that they work.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they believe many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As old as I said, two are company, three is <unk>
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> -- as you know, as a <unk> tree, it's quite an idiot.
Remember <unk>
Two guy together, it's very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out about the <unk>
A door. Put a table inside of the door, it's the <unk>
Put a mouth inside of the door, ask them questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight radical eight radical would allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build another 32.
So with each small effort, it will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese as a Chinese learns to a Chinese for eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun in the <unk> because Japan is in China.
So the sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains one two mountains one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, in exile, Chinese <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, <unk> has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind remind remind you of the stage.  Thank you. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician <unk>
The film <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant <unk> and bring a magic wand of it.
But when you look at that film so many times, you get to understand that it is extraordinary.
We now live and raising our children in a kind of a complex industrial fashion sharing a child's <unk>
And yet the magician. of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later, the one more years -- but another film whose metal <unk> a metal guy, and a <unk> guy named a girl dressed as <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of great differences between the magician.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I believe that if the <unk> of Oz today, the magician would say, <unk> are the salvation of the Oz as <unk> -- <unk>
You use magic shoes to defeat the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the <unk> <unk> is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, he also had a son.
Within three years.
It wasn't invited to <unk> because it was very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had <unk>  And so slid in the room and he was impressed as a mom with her <unk> with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> it all.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be questions of value, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
He would have a sense that Luke <unk> one of the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> <unk>
How do you win Dorothy the film?
In doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, and not a world of men who is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital to force in the movies for our kids, and so little of the <unk>
There are a lot of literature on the impact of male male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> it's very good.
I don't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that Princess <unk> doesn't provide the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults the adults who are --  I think that at the time of the first <unk> which was really expected that the boys in the film, right?
My search has finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies really focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and not leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like by being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, there are a lot of exceptions, to be <unk>
But they send a message to the kids, although them, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but not necessarily show the kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have a few great women that write new stories for our kids, and they <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but not stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all times continues on appearing on classic one of the <unk> every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two or two men who are <unk> a child.
So even as many of you are thinking, this year, I was finally <unk>
I recommend all you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what criticism said when it came to <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let them get the <unk>
Well, almost any of these films the test <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not the roots and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> a conversation I had had with a friend on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who has <unk>
So then you have to play the <unk>
These women talk each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something more apart from the kid that you like you --  -- right? Thank you.  Really? Thank you.  Really? Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I saw, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus that it's a consensus Hollywood
<unk> is not the proof of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, much of the film a lot of the film of men and women hiding during the <unk>
We have lots of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations on this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to get a look at the door and say, <unk> to the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 popular movies, how many of them you think have <unk> <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, is okay.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times was published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, is what he said, right?
In the United States, one of five women said that it's been sexually <unk> once in your life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment anymore.
I don't think that movies for kids to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are these <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, and we found this world very <unk> and we want to be <unk>
We have tools we have the tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to ask you, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> yes, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their children to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way of doing something really important -- and here I refer to the parents.
I think we have to show our children children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've heard about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his daughter was his favorite <unk> <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and I love to share their knowledge with other people to make their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle and and more stories where his job is to join to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people.
Thank you.
As a young girl, I lived in Maine, and one of the things that I was more looking for the sea <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand sand and it's hard to look at it.
Yet with time, though, I was <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that they helped me with.
This became a passion for finding things, in love to find things for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown in a almost 1,300 mile of length with the <unk>
And my biscuits had grown the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see a different way.
So I want to show you an example of how different the use of the <unk>
This is a place located in the Oriental <unk> <unk>
And it looks like the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process we do it all the fake color, suddenly the place you see as a bright <unk>
What you're looking at are the real chemical changes of the man-made materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find a <unk> old city, old called <unk>
<unk> was the oldest capital capital for more than 400 years in a time called called the Middle <unk>
The place is places in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art, the architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> there was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> of <unk>
This area is huge. It's about <unk> per mile long.
Before, the <unk> <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed with time, and it moved into the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city on a <unk> landscape.
And I try to try it at the random would be the equivalent of the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes, and using baseball
So we used to use NASA <unk> to make a place map of the very subtle changes.
We could see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this <unk> area slightly in the middle of the circle here, which we think might be the location of the <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of it shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for human <unk>
Five meters down, below a thick thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a occupation of <unk> several hundreds of years to date the Middle <unk> exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> work, <unk> quartz and <unk> which proves there was a <unk> <unk>
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones in the <unk> the <unk> these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a <unk> <unk> shop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We didn't find <unk> here, but we were going to go back to the place in a near future.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can perform great discoveries.
I would end with my favorite quote with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire in the Middle Empire -- 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the greatest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So as it seems to look at TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do the ideas actually happen in 1984 B.C. started in a missing city -- not for a long city and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now we <unk> a <unk> <unk> in bicycles.
They are competing in a <unk> race and go direction for your <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are flying everywhere, the wheels that go on on your side, rays off the wheels that you end up in the front of the wheels that you end up in the front of the door, you get the negativity threshold.
And the <unk> or what he has to go on the other side of the door, and what you see the quality of light.
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is talking to speech.
You can feel their blue fur, running them out on the nose.
You can smell <unk> <unk> and you can smell that it's about a <unk> point.
They went through and they trained his living room.
And already in the room, and making the maximum use of their imagination, to Britney <unk>
It's with time and dancing on his center, singing about his center, singing <unk> singing <unk> One <unk>
Now let's go back to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a yellow bricks and the <unk> you come up with you the Man of <unk> the <unk> and Len <unk> <unk> <unk> and Len <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar particular contest that every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to covering this event a few years ago a <unk> journalist, I guess, that was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers.
We have the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just a minute.
<unk> to see who I could memorize as quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people need to be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and that he had one of the best memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We have trained us to perform these miracle acts of memory using some ancient techniques techniques in Greece, the very very techniques that the same techniques that we used to use <unk> to memorize their narratives that the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How is it that I hadn't heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, <unk> who is a wonderful <unk> and <unk> a little <unk> and said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live, on national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year following not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work, and what their potential.
I met a lot of interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very likely to have the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem with <unk> it's awesome.
Someone was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that can allow us to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> in him were based on the <unk> <unk> <unk> film <unk>
We went together one afternoon together in the public library, Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I was a number of treaties on the written memory -- something about 2,000 years ago in Latin, <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a time and disciplined memory and it wasn't as rare as it can happen today.
A long ago, people investing in their memory in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have done our modern world, but also have changed.
They have changed, and I would say we have changed the cognitive <unk>
As we have no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do that.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate people for this idea of a disciplined memory, disciplined and <unk> is this competition as unique <unk>
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> in the whole world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers University London invited a group of memory <unk> to the lab.
They wanted to know that has brains in some ways or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory and the control subjects with them.
When they put them in an MRI machine, they put up their brains in the MRI and faces and forms of snow found that in the <unk> memory <unk> parts of the brain, different parts of the others.
They <unk> or they looked at <unk> a part of the brain that involves memory and navigation.
Why? There is something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is <unk> as a armed race where someone year, someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used to have the techniques in these absolutely all the psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates it with an elegant paradox like the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people to remember the same word. I say to two people who have a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I went back later, and I wonder that word I told you, that word I told you.
<unk> which <unk>
The person who told him that his name is <unk> is <unk> is unlikely is unlikely to remember the same word that the person he told her work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name is really no means for you. It doesn't really mean for you.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
They were good when they go back home to work.
You probably get some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques one of the most elaborate techniques in Greece is <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who I attended a <unk> who I attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a very good party to get a poet.
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem, and he <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were going to be <unk>
But not just killed everyone, but they shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
I was standing out -- one single survivor, in the middle of the rubble, I closed the eyes and realized that with your eyes in your mind, I could see where it had been sitting every single <unk>
It took the family of <unk> <unk> where they were their loved ones between rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter if we're not good for the names of the phone names or instructions or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and an extraordinary spatial memory.
If you tell me that I was the first 10 words of the first 10 words of history that I just tell you about <unk> is very likely to do it.
But I would bet that if you were to tell you who I was sitting on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> images with the things that things you want to be, the more crazy -- the crazy -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- it is the more <unk>
This is a advice from more than 2,000 years ago, the first memory treaties in <unk>
So how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give you a talk and you want to make it a memory stage and you want to make it <unk> if you had invited if you were invited if you were invited by <unk>
What they could do is imagine that they're in the door of their house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely <unk> and <unk> an absolutely <unk> image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine it coming into your house, and see the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then it turns out in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that I would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So it's like the <unk> speakers, <unk> their speeches not a word for word, that will be confused but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> that means <unk>
It's a <unk> when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his <unk>
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I was just exciting and filled with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and he had the idea of writing a whole thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an boring.
Seriously, is like looking at a bunch of people sitting sitting sitting on taking exams. I mean, the most exciting what's happening is when somebody gets <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in people's minds of these people.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before I sit on the New York Times just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have waited for it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's actually about doing is more and more and more of the ability to do is to improve the ability to create and to imagine these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully in the eye of the mind.
And I was quite a pretty close with this.
This is me, using my training standard training competition.
It's a pair of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape just two <unk> because the <unk> is the worst enemy of a memory.
It ended up coming back to the same contest that the same contest that he had was a year before. He had the idea that he could place in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good <unk> for my entire research.
The problem was that the experiment went out of control.
And I won something that didn't have to happen.
And so it's nice that is to be able to memorize narratives and phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they based on the very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build the memory <unk> or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was to be a <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories would be <unk>
At the most basics, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on it deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make it <unk>
It will be a kind of deep, deep processing sort of a complete sense of sense that most of it is not <unk>
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things make <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with you today, which is what I was -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose how much our short existence of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who will be so <unk> that we don't even care about process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are some amazing memory capabilities in all us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so I just <unk> just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am in Arabic, Jersey, I had six years and lived there in my parents' home called <unk> and this was my <unk>
On the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was an balcony that I gave the living room.
And they all spent time watching television and so every time I went from my room to the bathroom to the bathroom, everyone in my room in the bathroom, all over me and came back and back in a <unk> everyone at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> <unk>
<unk> that journey, I hated that journey, I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and it's about division of areas, but of the <unk> connections that we feel like to the <unk>
And it's not surprising to us that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under their roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are of architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice.
That makes us a little bit of naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that it is that by based on a building and built a half thousand years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> which uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time.
We use 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums to build art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they are going to work.
So we found out with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> and you know, it has a <unk> it has this round thing, and you know, it has a round thing, it has this round thing, you have a red thing, you get the <unk> which <unk> trying to communicate with this <unk> children, children, values.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it was the other library, it was another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media communication in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and to share.
So how do it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, which is that completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works as <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that drive new technologies, new new technologies, new new ways of living life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that we get away from the people.
All of the black, this, you do believe we feel very well, you believe we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We need to go to the other side and go back to the other <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> -- so we started to swing the anger.
Well, 30 years ago <unk> of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We <unk> the rest of the new direction.
We took those ways that we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added <unk> and we just added new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned it into short, which can be <unk> <unk> from glass.
The shapes are <unk> they won with audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of the buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend time in business centers, we moved into the neighborhoods, the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be to <unk> the French <unk> or the <unk>
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They are easy, they are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we set us memories of other things.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is <unk>
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the self in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk> <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques because of computer design techniques -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> ways that we get against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> and it's <unk> and it's totally <unk> You completely <unk>
Normally the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's <unk> <unk> from Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> and public public and public public, they completely agree about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> building <unk>
The tourism in the rise rise in a half percent when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, and in Chicago, in Chicago, Cleveland, <unk> <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and she wanted to be everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how do it possible that these wild forms, and radical change, how do they become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media will be <unk> around them and quickly learned that those ways meant culture and tourism.
We've created a emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the major mayors the world the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon of new <unk> country has a other star.
I went to <unk> and the <unk> and what happened to <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all of architecture. The digital media started to increase the speed of information.
Think of it, for example, how do we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked over to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, they can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end of all of us all of us are architecture, and the building is over the physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture is moving as fast as the architecture moves fast.
It's not a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, 100 more buildings, and 100 buildings, before you know if that was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, of 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That will never happen to be <unk> because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from steel <unk> or steel and is the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, when it applies to media, when it applies to the media, the media, it starts to swing it faster, effectively in <unk> and effectively the difference between innovation and <unk>
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company was recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before the building building, it was already a part of the community -- and as the drawings looked exactly the exact product, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get together and share it in social media, building it to be a building, became a medium of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, they become part of the collective memory, and that makes it <unk> for collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, which is because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians from <unk>
If that building has been built today, first of the Internet is looking for the Internet in search for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> with examples of <unk> about what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> who can lead to the mayor of <unk> to <unk> people and tell them that there is no unique response to the ground.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experiment.
It's all different now.
The architects are not those mysterious creatures who use <unk> words and drawings -- and one is no longer a public <unk> that doesn't accepts something you haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't listen to the architecture.
That means the pendulum <unk> from a style of another, from a way, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space is in the ancient city city, it can be unique and adapted to as a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick in ideas that must be the <unk>
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means the buildings <unk> the <unk> of the nature of nature and not the reverse.
And this means that a parking little <unk> in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sport or <unk> or even one of you there at night.
This means three architects can dream that three architects in the New York City, and raise a half a million dollars of the <unk> community around that cause, is not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like the animals who are at the observe.
Because it doesn't matter if it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent <unk>
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite sides of the opposite direction.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there are a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give the way to the most <unk> spaces of local libraries and households where we form our kids, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this great great typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that the more things I like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
They <unk> and <unk> and he gives themselves those big kisses and it gives themselves these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom realize I used to do that, and I thought when I wanted to do this?
How do we suddenly not be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people who are looking at ourselves, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And like any teenager, it just wants to be dear and in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though your mom says all the time it is beautiful, all the time it is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And what her mom tells you and what your friends, your friends, your school -- you don't know who believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asked others who please let a <unk> "I'm like, "I'm a nice one, or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that doesn't even deserve the point of them.
We talk about a normal <unk> normal <unk> that gets these responses into one of the stages of your most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting like this, in most of their teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is the <unk>
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected in a continuous way, so young people.
As a mother said, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand of hand, is that they're <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to be <unk> based on the number of people that they have.
There is no division between a life online and the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what's <unk>
What is the most prominent life of someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news now.
<unk> death <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The technique of <unk> is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young young people are.
But the boys are not immune to this.
Like the ones of the sport, sport, and singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy individuals.
But in a culture of obsessed culture -- we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to your appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of the other aspects of your identity.
Things like their relationships, development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects they start to hurt.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities of their growth as human beings as humans and the working field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom, <unk> <unk> in the classroom, because they don't want to call attention for their physical side.
One of five are not <unk> at all of the days when they don't feel comfortable at this.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you're good enough, specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- you know, if you don't think you're thin, you <unk> a lower note at the average of your fellow who don't care about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been spread in Finland, the United States and China is China.
And it gives you regardless of what these young people are in these young.
So, to be very clear, we're talking about it as you see you -- not how you are really not how you are.
The low self-worth on its body is <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
Kids with little self-esteem do make them less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, <unk> in more diet -- healthy that you can take you to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more <unk> by the people surrounding them and they're at higher risk of depression.
And we think that's all about this because of what they make decisions more <unk> like alcohol consumption and drugs, <unk> <unk> surgery, sexual diagnosis and <unk> damage.
The search of the perfect body is <unk> by the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are <unk> again, regardless of whether they have or no higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't have an interview interview in which one day you feel secure in the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing in our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, you don't get very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first one that we have to nurture trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is there are a lot of programs that are available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> <unk> without realizing it.
So we have to make sure that the program that continue our children not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs that are focused on six key areas -- the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
And these six things are kind of a crucial set points for anyone who are willing to provide a education in their body that works.
A education is a <unk> but deal with this problem requires every one of us that we take charge of the charge and be a better role model for women and girls in our own life.
<unk> the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell you the contribution of our politicians in your hair or the size of your <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the Olympic athlete is the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as well as they are.
We can start by doing this by assuming responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort on their appearance.
And let me ask when was the last time <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as a communities, governments and as companies, to change our culture, to truly change our culture, so that our children grow up their entire person, the <unk> <unk>
We need to put the people that it's really making the difference in a <unk>
So to make a difference in the real world, let's make a difference in the real screen because we just create a different world.
A world in where our children are free to become the best of themselves, where the way they believe that they may never be the <unk> of being who are, or to reach out what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Her <unk> <unk> <unk>
It could just be the woman who is two miles away -- what would it mean if it was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, which was <unk> by not having a long long, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and we would claim it to its potential for the potential to that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is holding us all.
But let's give our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, which is just a part of your identity, which is what we love that and because of how they feel.
He <unk> the self-esteem in our <unk>
Let's change every one of us, the way we talk and we compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> from a year of age today, becoming safe enforcement agents of themselves in the same morning.
So let's do it.
The November five of 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed by a hotel in Manhattan and <unk> the <unk> <unk> the League of the League Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially was gay <unk> but being prisoner by other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning to plan to about 12 parts of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by a informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the Australian bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, was allowed to.
Later on, <unk> would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer, an American engineer, an American school teacher, both the two <unk> <unk> <unk>
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, that very few, even most of the Muslims at all.
For experience I saw that when people take time to <unk> it is not a lot of to get it to us to wish to the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in the whole human group, there's always a little fraction of the people that are going to be so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we need to use all the possible means that they all live like them.
A few months before arrest him sat with me and explained that in the last couple of week, he and told me that in the last couple of week, he and some friends, had been going to practice.
He told me that he was the next day.
We came to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder to hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot on the little orange light that he shot on the goal and to surprise all of all, especially mine, particularly mine, all the goal on fire.
My uncle went back to the rest and in Arabic, <unk> <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such child.
And all of all, the comment had been a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, but just a few years later, what I found as funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction, my father could be <unk>
Those people later would be <unk> by putting a <unk> <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking parking lot, in the North World Trade Center -- causing six people to give up six people and give them another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood not allowed to make a lot of them.
Every time I started to feel comfortable with someone now was a moment of packing and go to another city.
As I was always my new <unk> I was often a <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the <unk> to be the <unk> but to be the new of the class, silent and <unk>
So most of the time I spent in home reading books, reading books, watching TV or playing games.
For these reasons not to have social skills, to put it in <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they had to test my way to think, was during presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program I participated in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My group <unk> on the subject of youth violence -- because I had been a <unk> victim almost every life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, to the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who had done a <unk> was Jewish age.
It took several days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jew Jew and frankly, I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all the life that all life was <unk>
Another seminal moment emerged when I got a summer work in Bush, <unk> a summer <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience that experience it was fundamental in the development of my character.
All the life I had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and a sin and <unk> every single gay were <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see it that several of them was the kinder and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been a <unk> a child, a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat the <unk> exactly the way I would have to be treated.
So I could contrast the stereotypes that I could contrast to the stereotypes that had been able to share the experience of the interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be a <unk> but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and helping me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In a lot of ways, he became my <unk> <unk> at a moment I was desperately <unk>
At occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jew Jew would have had a better influence in my life than my father's <unk>
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how to think about how to think, and she told me something that I conserving in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who has been <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I come out and put myself at a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, some of the people who are trying to bring to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way that even though I was embarrassed to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight against terror, and against prejudice.
I do do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones and their loved pain and loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism -- talking against those acts without meaning, as a rejection of my father.
So with this position, I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent about religion or race -- that the children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all right.  Thank you all right.  Thank you. Thank you.
At this point, there is a film that is in your minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It is in 3D and it has <unk> sound, and it has <unk> sound, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hungry, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice shot in your conscious <unk>
The film of the movie is you experience everything running.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of existence human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a internal film, you and you and you get you.
There is nothing that we have to do more directly.
At least I know I have an awareness.
I don't mean that you are conscious.
<unk> is also the reason for living.
If we were not aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not only the robots that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate consciousness in science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness.
The science, by nature, is an objective
<unk> by nature, it's subjective is subjective up.
Then there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the whole 20th century, it was that vision.
And psychology is studying <unk> behavior, studied the <unk> brain, but no one mentioned the consciousness.
And even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
We <unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for the science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of science work on consciousness.
And this was fantastic. It was cool. It was great. And this was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of science of consciousness in the recent years was the search of <unk> correlations between some areas of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy <unk> did a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of faces or feeling pain.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a <unk> science.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of personal experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to saying that this kind of work of neuroscience says some questions we want to say that this kind of work of neuroscience says some questions we want to tell the questions about what certain brain areas do.
But in a sense, those are the problems.
<unk> to <unk>
There's actually not easy problems with consciousness.
It doesn't address the true mystery of this <unk> why is all the physical process in the brain it has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it an internal <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years of the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
<unk> typical is all cases of emergent behaviors, how do they operate the <unk> how they work, and how they operate the living organisms, and they are all questions about the goal.
That could be the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain functions as a <unk> how we <unk> how we play -- how we play <unk> all of these things about behavior.
But when it comes to the consciousness, the questions about behavior are in the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question why is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still not have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that it works for a long time, hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that was not working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful chain of wonderful species, so we used to be used to this, the physics is explaining to biology, the biology, biology is part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to <unk> that idea of our scientific vision in the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need a radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such hard idea of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors of the brain, and that's what everything you need <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the awareness of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying for than the awareness of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying for than the awareness of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying for than the awareness of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying for than the consciousness of consciousness is
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take a few aspects of the universe as <unk> bricks and the mass.
<unk> laws as fundamental laws as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
On the contrary, you look at principles, and you think of the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you cannot be able to explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- time, the mass laws of Newton.  So I applied the basic laws of Newton.  So applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws.
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, the mass, a matter of fundamental ideas, the <unk> of the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the consciousness itself as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it is not that suddenly that of a sudden it doesn't mean that all of a sudden it is not that it's not quite the object.
It opens up the way for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws of consciousness, the laws that connect to consciousness with the <unk> <unk> the space, the <unk> processes.
The physicists sometimes tell you that we want the fundamental laws of <unk> us in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find very simple laws as simple we can be <unk>
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious -- not just the humans, all the people, the mice, flies, even the microbes from Rob <unk>
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of anguish when I think a little bit like the <unk> when I always started the speed of the light.
I can never slow and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking about thinking is that perhaps the photons can have some unique element of quantitative <unk> of consciousness.
This may sound a little <unk> for you.
How would someone think such a crazy?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which is that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and the mass, time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, like the others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to be <unk> is much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more like a continuum with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws of the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing information, there's awareness.
<unk> in a human <unk> as a human consciousness, complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple consciousness, simple.
And so something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and developed this sort of <unk> methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated information in a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness. It has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of information integration of information, a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse -- there is a degree of information integration of information, kind of significant, of a pretty important degree.
But when you get into the <unk> <unk> particles, the degree of <unk>
The level of information integration is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there is still going to be a different level of consciousness in the <unk>
It actually provides a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us to integrate the consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but don't talk about the reality underlying reality.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, as she comes out the fire of <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of the physics you can leave as they are, but they can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not in the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, is the <unk> vision, it has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have a fairly serious action.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I wasn't supposed to eat anything that had consciousness, so I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, and you have a lot of hungry.
I think I'm going to think of it right, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical and moral <unk> is not so much the fact that its consciousness, but its complexity.
It's also natural asking for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information, integrated information, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right now, they are linked problems, you are very serious about the ethic of the development ethic of intelligent computers and ethics <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective consciousness to the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group as the audience in a TED talk, at this moment we have a TED collective consciousness for this whole group of TED group -- different movies from each other.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that has to take you serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm more sure the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right way towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for this overnight.
But I believe that we will ultimately be to discover it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, one under education.
I went to school, <unk> with my friends, <unk> with my younger sisters.
It was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up with my parents because I wanted to give it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a problem.
She's not actually <unk>
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low time in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
Yes, yes. What contradiction. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
And a few years later, being in the second part of the teaching of a high school school, just after about 20 minutes after about 20 minutes in the class <unk> <unk> a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about law <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people in chairs. They talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the <unk>
And it was when I realized, this child had had been experiences with disabled people as <unk> objects.
And we don't get it, and it's not the fault of boy, it's true for a lot of us.
For us, individuals who are disability aren't our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to be <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this scenario <unk> at what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting and you are waiting for you. Right?   Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you're lied to you in relation to disability.
Yes, they've been sold to the lie that disability is a little <unk> A <unk> <unk>
It's bad and living with a disability that makes you remarkable.
It's not bad and you can't make you exceptional.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this is through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the little girl that you have ever seen with a pencil that was held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber <unk>
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call the inspiration <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of other people.
So in this case, <unk> people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, very bad that is my life, it might be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you're that person?
I've lost mind the number of times that have been related to the number of times that have been taught that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this is happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was going to get me out in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to people with disability for people with disabled people.
They're there for you to be able to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
We have some things.
But the things that we are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I joined the so-called <unk> social model that tells us that we are more immortal because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of the ability of their ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way that we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> tells you like a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us to this lie that the disability have done remarkable to us.
And honestly, you don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration and you think, and you say, "Oh God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know that.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, not <unk> that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall in --  <unk> the trick of how to get the battery battery to your mobile phone battery in your chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that is <unk> us.
I really believe that the lie that they've been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us the hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is it's not true. It is because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a <unk> <unk> is not done in a <unk>
Never.    <unk> in front of a television screen, I'm not going to get the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> <unk> a positive attitude and turning all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a <unk> girl <unk> sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> <unk> not considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> by getting out of the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a boy at 11 high school is not a high school that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability don't make us <unk> but question what you think about it is doing it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so you don't get <unk>
When people think of <unk> reality, they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> but augmented reality, not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get the <unk>
The first step, this is what I'm wearing <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is to be a professional <unk>
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will <unk> with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run for the field of a game to 160 <unk> the <unk>
We can know that a guy from 110 pounds -- we would be <unk> trying to get it all its being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
And so some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the <unk> and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not the images of the <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine rising the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on. Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
<unk> a little bit <unk>
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have noticed that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players and have been asked in YouTube and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we get it to the next level?
We took that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my <unk> Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man in a Russian rollercoaster <unk> life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian across the line, <unk> a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan that will be the experience of a fan of a fan to the <unk>
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the network?
What will their experience when it comes from a mountain to over 100 miles a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the <unk> sales sales to adults.
But this is not yet <unk> reality.
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality augmented reality, augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to do and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it for <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to gain. They give you money.
So here's a brief set of insight on the technology <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> they put a <unk> on his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl Bowl, that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios.
They were more <unk> because it was faster.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player going back to your group and you see the next move you see in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you wear in front of you, you don't have to worry about forget about a <unk>
Or they memorize the strategy.
Just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want because if they don't keep their instructions, they lose games, and they hate <unk>
If you lose games you <unk> like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual strategies <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How do you do this?
Well, a very simple option is to have a camera in every corner of the stadium by having a view from the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that is already working.
And all that information that is you send to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information <unk>
This is the good teams of the good guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data let be just for <unk>
It would also be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that are the field.
You get the ball and <unk>
You go to an open receptor and suddenly a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you get a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you get a <unk> and you don't get it, but the <unk> system, but the <unk> system.
It was <unk>
Another <unk> <unk> you get an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the earth is not, though, the receptor in its bombsight is a <unk> area of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
They <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> audience and fans have followed them from every angle.
This is something to create a massive emotion on the party.
I'm going to make lots of people you see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you to do is, is that this is the only use of <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> as our <unk> <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what is literally to be in another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk> <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much this is a technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are their actions to the <unk> perspective.
How much of this technology is worth this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world what is being <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more in space and science and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality is coming.
The questions we do, the choices that we take and the challenges we face, as a matter of us.
Thank you.
I recently was <unk> after 23 years of service in <unk> <unk> in California.
The majority of those 23 years -- I was <unk> the southern end of the <unk> County that includes the <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> the Pacific Ocean and its architectural Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most living places in the world.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, head <unk> to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
suicide is not practical to the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will lead to another dimension, and this bridge is <unk> like that, so the each of you it releases you all your concerns and concerns and the waters that are under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every four to five seconds, your body hits against the water about 120 miles per hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which is the bones, some of which we <unk>
Most of the impact.
The ones that don't usually get in the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't believe that the <unk> method will be aware of the <unk> of death to the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order before you have to take your life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that boundary, and in the darkest time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young man was talking with an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you the joy that we had success that day to bring it back about the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a <unk> service to those who were <unk> but the officers as well.
We have come a long way since then.
Today, independent officials and psychologists trained to new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at July July Julius in the last year being a call of a <unk> subject <unk> sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a <unk> <unk>
Jason was only 32 years 32 and flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown up over here two times before New Jersey before from New Jersey to try to <unk> from this bridge.
After about about a time talking to <unk> I asked if we knew if we knew the history of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The only good thing in the box was hope.
Then Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped one <unk> leaned on on the right and left.
This guy kind of <unk> smart guy from New Jersey and just <unk>
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess that when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very good, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what he was.
The parents of Jason <unk>
<unk> damage to a lot of people. affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions. What do you do if a member of your family would show you if a member of your family or somebody loved it out <unk>
What do we <unk>
<unk> what say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like it feels like it feels like it was probably not <unk>
You just stand there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have to be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask is this: <unk> in the similar circumstances of the circumstances have had these <unk>
<unk> to the person in front of it can save the life and be the point of it for them.
Other signs for <unk> despair, and believe that things are terrible things that are <unk> and that will never believe that there is nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago -- and I got an email out of a day, and I would like to read to you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January <unk> this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago -- and it's with her permission to read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to stand up in the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted you to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still fairly <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will really not go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> <unk> with her <unk> <unk> with his <unk>
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared from that night.
The next morning, two officers came home and reported that the Mike <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness -- I had seen it from the <unk> to the <unk> in the late day.
Thank you so much for your fight for those who can be temporarily temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before <unk> a real mental <unk>
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the courage that she needed to go to the bridge and to go through the way that his son took that day, and also the value to move on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man when I mean hope and value.
On March 11, September 11, I wrote a radio call for a <unk> <unk> subject on the sidewalk <unk> near the sidewalk <unk>
I saw my <unk> <unk> and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing in the sidewalk.
When he saw me immediately cross the <unk> and he stopped that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and the next half, I heard as Kevin spoke about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account to realize that day back back back to that lane and give it another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was it that made it <unk> and I asked the hope and the other <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with a letter of the Kevin, and I would like to be <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing would erase the 11th of September 11, and you're one of the reasons Kevin keeps with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it was properly <unk>
And I would have Kevin months when I only had six months, completely unconscious for all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like the says.
We give God for you.
I didn't make a debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her writing, <unk> <unk> when I visited the General San Francisco San Francisco at night, you <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is an active father and active <unk>
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> <unk>
That act, despite the end of their own time, despite the end of her own <unk>
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those people who consider suicide, wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Usually this is just three things: sleep, the drugs or the death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness, and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in involved just have lost two, but those two is too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about about an hour.
And for that time, my hand is <unk> at three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people who have said that the second ones on the side, they realized that they made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connects <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that every one of us and each of us must be <unk> to do.
suicide can prevent.
There are help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not like, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question you ask you, and a question you can do in that?
I have to be a unique thing in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream I had had since a child.
My exterior finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner truth.
So in complicated reasons, what I'm going to talk about later, when I look later, when I look at this picture, we got it <unk> <unk>
But the last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We were all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our society, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin and the beliefs of those people around us.
They're people who are always challenging the status <unk> which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this <unk> is called <unk>
This is mine.
I had been recorded as <unk> by being born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember that my age five years in the Philippines, at my house, and I always had this t-shirt <unk>
And my mom asked, "Why always was that t-shirt <unk> <unk>
I said, "Mom, my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew then how to make it <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never get myself to share my story, not because I thought to share my story, not because of how the world is about those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I thank you.
I have mom, my father and a family who gets me to accept it.
Many of them are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines in the Philippines of these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me and I remember that this beautiful woman came up with me and I remember that moment as if it was a woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing this woman called <unk> I met <unk>
It's the head of a <unk> <unk>
I said, I asked her, "Why did you haven't been involved in <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> her from the <unk> <unk> and the week, and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in the bathroom <unk> <unk> <unk> and was <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can tell you that their first job was the <unk> beauty of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the <unk> <unk> especially when it was <unk> to the remote <unk>
But most importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 in 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my <unk> to live in the United States.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, and he said, "Do you know if you go to the United States -- you can change the United States and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand, when I was <unk>
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand perform the most sophisticated surgeries, <unk>
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 in 2001 to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the <unk> <unk> and the female <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity means that power identity means power is being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and moving to move to New York, and to be model.
Many of them are not so lucky.
I think of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was a young woman who was living his truth, but that, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that you live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 November <unk> we make a global <unk> <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and stood up with injustice.
These are fellow, P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same time, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that some day I have no longer have no more <unk>
My deeper truth led to accepting what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My support network to my childhood network is my family, which I know is very strong.
I remember all the time that I've been going to young women who I've <unk> and some times, when I was called and told me that his parents could not accept it, I would take the phone, he calls my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it works -- other times -- it's not a matter of gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us are a gender assigned to us, and what I try to do is put on the table the theme of some times that <unk> doesn't block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. Thank you. Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies. In many of the parents who are usually known to their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who know the daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> the education started his education defending their rights in 2007. And when they <unk> their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the <unk> National <unk> became very famous in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the history of mankind, the story of mankind, the story of women is the history of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when a girl, their birth was not <unk>
It's not welcome for her father, not for his father, nor for her mother.
The neighborhood goes on the mother and the mother and nobody <unk> a father.
And a mother <unk> a lot of <unk>
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first girl gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, you would be <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when you get his third daughter, you feel like a criminal.
Not only the mother suffering, but the <unk> daughter <unk> as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school for her siblings.
Even the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes in adolescence, when it was 13 years old, you have provided you out of your home without a male.
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if he would honor the code of that honor, honor, honor, would even be able to kill it.
And it's interesting that this <unk> code of honor, not just affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in name.
And there's a single more <unk> societies that is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl should be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
Is it the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and accepts the decisions of their father and mother decisions and their decisions -- even if it doesn't will.
If you <unk> with a man who don't like or the <unk> with an old man, you have to <unk> because you don't want to be <unk>
If you get the very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of his daughter and the same honor of his children.
And this vicious circle goes continues and on.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when she was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like our newborns, being honest, but when I was there and looked his eyes, believe me.
And a lot before I <unk> I thought on her name, and she was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was all <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my feather, and I had a line of my name, and I wrote a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she died, when she was four and a half, he was a <unk> he was in my school.
You might be wondering, why do I mention the <unk> of a girl in school?
Yes, I must be <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the U.S., in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies is a great event for the life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and your name.
A <unk> to school means he's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where their potential can explore their potential life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be a <unk> two weeks ago, when they were going to <unk> the <unk> form of the <unk> I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters in any document.
That was the reason why you value my daughter.
What my father couldn't get to my sisters nor his daughters, thought that he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to put it in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've <unk> all these good values in my school and boys in the way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, I taught students, I'll forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women in the women's participation in all political activities.
Hundreds of schools.
Girls <unk>
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was a few <unk> and it was scary to be around those people who kill and <unk>
It's really frightening.
At the age 10 years, they got up and got up the right to the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog that the BBC, for the BBC, was offered it itself for the documentaries the New York Times was talking about every platform I could find.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the October <unk> in 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, <unk> <unk> to the ear of my wife and <unk> <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please said, "Please don't tell you."
<unk> the fair cause.
It <unk> your life in play for the cause of truth, because of the peace of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get <unk>
Both of them were on the right way and God <unk>
And these few words <unk> so much for me, and I didn't go to ask asking again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and I had severe migraine headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my <unk> smile in my face.
I'm going to make me good. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, and we've learned about her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that even despite being an icon for children and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when they didn't have his task.
It is fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are the special thing about my <unk> which has done so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> I didn't know.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and, since that day, science science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you I've recently joined the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had one of my <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  But the whole work I'm going to talk today about the science of the brain, I did before today, about my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You're still as smart or not?
If you don't be like this, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead <unk> of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And then after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if you wouldn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of combinations and try and try and get it to go with life.
Over once I saved me.
But luckily, I have a <unk> soul -- so I decided that I would be <unk> to try and get the <unk> <unk> because it really doesn't have a map of what it says in <unk>
I started to test with a different <unk> and I was struck by looking at how little changes in the doses <unk> dramatically my sense of who I was to myself, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and chemical chemicals for a man of <unk> and surprised me looking at how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and -- of course, a lot of the most intelligent person around the world --  of course, many times in the past few versions of the last time.
It turned out like a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, there was a lot of <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that was in front of the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't deal with it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for the men and what they have to be <unk> since I was better at men.
What I was trying to do as to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters that and so forth, it was to regain my intelligence after illness, and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> to think almost as long as images, and that became my <unk> <unk> how to make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thinking is not new.
<unk> as a <unk> Descartes and <unk> watch things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now, there are the people who are asking this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works to me, is simple: for the most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> -- really very sophisticated -- and very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was going to be able to use their imagination only to lead the world to the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, like how creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is just to increase the resolution of our brain scanning <unk>
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get this with two recent experiments that made by two groups that have an neuroscience.
Both of the different technology used to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan that you have done by <unk> <unk> and your <unk>
The column on the left is the scan of the left scan of a person looking at an image.
The medium of the medium is the brain scan the brain scan the brain scanning that the same image.
The spine on the right is <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images always with a similar result.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine to see that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the <unk> <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's go in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of videos of YouTube as YouTube as their brains and their brains of the brain sequences in the video.
And then they showed you a movie with new images, new new images, new new animals, and as much as they were <unk>
The computer, using just brain information information, scanning it to show you what it looked like the person I was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer you can see the computer <unk>
This let us have <unk>
We're very close to do this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember when you see an image and when you see a picture and when you can imagine that the same image is in the brain itself.
This is done with the <unk> systems, of the most resolution brain systems, today, and their resolution is a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a <unk>
How do you do that?
There are a lot of techniques that do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer for that.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques from images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the <unk> first of the first thing we have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is that the only way to get more resolution is that the only way to get more resolution is -- but at this point, they were more <unk> in resolution, not for thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than <unk> us better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort into MRI to make them really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> remarkable solutions, and brilliant and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> in MRI and <unk>
At its time, instead of a magnetic field with the magnetic field patterns, the magnetic patterns <unk> to the frequencies of radio <unk>
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio processing radio, we can increase the information that can get a <unk>
And we can then split up in layers our increasing knowledge structure on the brain structure and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the neural activity.
We're going to be able to put our ideas into direct media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly by the <unk>
What would be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the <unk> for Alzheimer's disease.
We have very few choices to open this door.
And anyway, choose a year choose to be in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine to take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just from the gay.
I think we all have <unk>
His <unk> maybe whether to tell some person for the first time the love or telling someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you ever have in life.
It's all kind of a difficult conversation, and a difficult conversation, and even though our themes can be <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that country?
Day fear, and we don't like to happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, and I had to go through various stages the intensity of the <unk> <unk> I didn't have my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> by the <unk> of my short <unk> and I have been my head -- I would usually ask me a little boy, usually -- "Hey, you're a little guy or <unk>
And they would appear a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I would get my jaw a little bit more, I would take my little bit of a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother brought a cold way to his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to go to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old was ready to get to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised the next time I would say something.
I would have that conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was prepared to go from filled with the female issues at the table --  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even one of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took a deep breath, and I looked down and to my backs up and to my backs together a <unk> girl who is not a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you <unk>
And then I took a breath again again, and I set up <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know that this is <unk>
I have my short hair like a boy, and I saw <unk> clothes, but I am a girl, you know, like you like to use a pink <unk> and sometimes you like you to use a pajamas.
All right, I am more of the <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was everything.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the most easy conversation for everyone ever ever on.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> the one with the other.
Just as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You only know how a feels like a <unk>
This is how my dad is not different from yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons for why go out of my <unk> it was harder than out of his, but this is the <unk> -- it's hard to do it is not <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell someone who have declared in banking <unk> it's harder to tell you that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell a harder is hard to tell your five-year-old who is a harder job to you.
There's no more hard, there's no more difficult for you.
We need to stop that to be what is difficult to stop what is difficult to do with the other person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our lives, and we must just feel empathy because we all live in a difficult thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than it offers the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, no matter what your walls, is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine about 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse <unk> a horse and <unk> and <unk>
It wasn't the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to fight against any <unk>
I was frozen in fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, gay, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my whole whole full strangers who I've spent my entire life <unk> trying not to <unk> and now the world was turning around in purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script we've all followed for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk>
One of my most memorable firefly <unk> <unk>
It was the first time that a lot of each other people knew that it was gay, and when I make my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my <unk> <unk> walked around the tables and I finally walked around the <unk>
And after talking a moment, one of the women I <unk> <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the gay story has begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we have never been there, but we've heard it <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about <unk>
<unk> what is your TV show <unk>
Our <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you know who's <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting to show her support, and to get me to know that I was my support, finally he said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find out and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared to be prepared for the authentic <unk>
It's like the hard conversations that have not be my hard point.
Ask anyone with the ones that I have ever <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any <unk> it's essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk>
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must know that <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk> <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of hope. hope.
And number three, and more important three and more important.
You communicate their truth.
It will never be used for that.
And some of you can come out hurt safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that is something in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not their own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> they have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very much themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk> <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If we look at the story of how intelligence has seen the intelligence of how intelligence, it has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> from the question that if a machine can think is as interesting as if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this thing as a criticism in the computer companies as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental skills of intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
So we first start with a kind of mental experiment.
So imagine that they are an alien race that you know nothing about the biology or neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth or you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly lives so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are a alien race who doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about the intelligence of the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that we would have to do with it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that is the same question the physical nature of the intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of issues across science, through several disciplines, that I think, towards a single underlying mechanism.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be properly enough for the development of intelligence, and in particular for the development of the universal state state of the future.
Finally, in the <unk> <unk> movement, have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize a complex freedom in order to make complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different topics, and we <unk> together, I asked for a couple of different years ago, there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There is only an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What are you looking at is probably the closest equivalent to a E = the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> <unk> that acts in order to maximize freedom of action.
It acts for maximize freedom of action, or to keep open choices with a <unk> force, with the diversity of possible future accessible, <unk> -- even an imminent time <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize freedom of action and keeping it choices.
And so, having in mind that equation, it's natural is natural -- what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it? <unk>
They took the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, that I think now a few of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has been suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> for their life they make more mess, or the existence of smart beings like us.
But what if that is that <unk> connection between the entropy and intelligence between the entropy and the <unk>
What if the clever behavior not only is it with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually get it directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software company called <unk> designed to maximize the production of the long-term entropy in any system that you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple intelligence tests play playing games, and even winning money -- actions, all of that had to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just as a <unk> human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole by using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He simply decided for their balance to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is that it will have applications for robotics robotics and <unk> human care.
This ability to use tools to have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition to the same as some other animals you can cooperate from extremes of the side of the rope at the same time to release the food, here in the same time to release the food version of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here I successfully play with playing a <unk> game <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and holds the very connected network of the very connected network.
This same <unk> capacity of network is also has applications on health care care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of the boats, finding success and using the Panama Canal to expand the Panama Canal to extend the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated <unk> negotiation to the assets on the assets under its delivery and the assets of low <unk>
This risk ability will have huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human behaviors, intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- every single equation, which leads to a system to maximize freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the robot, the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we had intelligent machines, there would be a <unk>
The machines <unk> against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the concept of the rebellion of the <unk>
It's not that the machines first become intelligent and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's the contrary, the impulse to take control of all the future of all the future of all future intelligence, is a most fundamental principle that intelligence can actually arise from control, rather than being the other way around.
Another important consequence of the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals about this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to that statement will move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them to build artificial intelligence as a physical process must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize freedom of action and to avoid the future.
Thank you very much.
We are in a tipping point in human history, something between stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
And although in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The depth of the depth of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit other stars, what the Earth is that the Earth is only one between the billions of the billions of our galaxy.
Kepler is a spatial telescope that measures the <unk> light intensity of stars when planets go ahead and block that light that is to get us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the planets in addition to the planets that there is between them and their mother.
In together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At the time, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The <unk> <unk> was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice ice that you have been with us for millennia, you now have a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, and I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars in hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could tell you that I'm looking for the alien opportunities in the property market.
Now, as someone very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe, I can tell you that the more planets like Earth, more than our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds each of these new worlds you invites a comparison between the newly first discovered and the planets that we know better.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit farther from the Sun, can be a very livable world of the Sun, this is a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and part of it that we studied so we studied so that we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we studied so we
Our <unk> like the <unk> they are looking for clues about clues about the origins of life of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies now offer not just a short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all of these images <unk> you remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas, to be <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take an extension of the areas of our planet that we still have to be <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most <unk> and more <unk> and the <unk> the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement about Mars and other planets and other planets will be a big and sad planets and the belief and the belief and the belief that the only planet would expect to save ourselves from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly <unk> Earth.
For a lot you like exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, to Mars, to be a lot of good reasons to humanity is to be there about the captain of the Titanic to be place that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party really will have a place later in the <unk>   Thank you. Thank you.
But the targets for exploration, the land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces in the same <unk> the goal of <unk> to make and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world looks like <unk> <unk>
They are just closer home.
If we can understand how to create and maintaining the <unk> and the <unk> areas of the land, maybe we could be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an <unk> <unk> the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physical physicist -- the physicist so many years ago that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found out of the existence of the existence of alien life.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations were becoming advanced enough progress to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the most important planets that are to protect this development.
It's <unk> to think that only the <unk> we will save ourselves from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, they can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look like the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the most easy task to preserve the <unk>
Thank you.
A few years ago, <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I had the keys.
In fact, I could see the window who were at the dining room where had the <unk>
So quickly he tried to open up all the other other gates and the windows, and all the windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night I had a flight for the next morning Europe and <unk> my passport and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but no more expensive than a <unk> a half of night, so I thought, despite the circumstances in the <unk> room.
I am a <unk> a profession a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases heart rate is <unk> and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized I had my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could be done, which had something that could be done, which could be a bad thing.
Or at least, bad things happen -- bad things, the probability of a total catastrophe to be a total issue.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed to talk that the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, too.
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come up and try and figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you looking forward and try and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things that are going or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about you is a few things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not as evident.
I'm going to start with obvious.
At the house, you have a place for the things that things you lose easily.
This sounds a common sense of and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where it's okay, where the fish are, in terms of the <unk> where the <unk> friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> the sense of <unk> and still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that mechanism very evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not as good for things that move a lot of good things for things that are moving.
This is the reason to lose your car keys and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a <unk> place for the keys, maybe a <unk> dish.
And for your <unk> a <unk> a <unk>
For your eye check a particular <unk> a particular <unk>
If you take a place and you are <unk> with it that your stuff is always going to be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of the cell phone -- your credit card license to drive, <unk> <unk> by email <unk>
If these things are missing or <unk> it can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases your brain is <unk> your brain releases up.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress is not going to be the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to have a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved way to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'm talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of us to make financial decisions and social decisions and social choices, and any of the decision that we need to be that they would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So let's suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I had received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol risk associated with a higher risk of diseases attack the heart, <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I would like to give a drug that will help to reduce a <unk> a <unk>
And perhaps you hear about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you even are likely to know people that the <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do an statistic then, a statistic is supposed to ask for most doctors not to want to speak and even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit surgery a surgery on any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think of what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number is to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's a doctor, and if it's someone, it's scientists like me.
We haven't really understood the mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> which believe it is?
How many people who have to take it before someone helps a person?
300.
This is according to the investigation of cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the medicine for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, or the brain <unk>
Now maybe you think, "Well, maybe a chance in 300 of <unk>
Why not? <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have been asking for a statistic -- and that's what you have to ask for a <unk> and you know? Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects of the patients, are they producing in five percent of the patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> and <unk> pain -- <unk> muscle pain, but now they think, "The Five is very likely to happen to me, even <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the design of reasoning in the <unk>
300 people take the drug, right? You know, you have been <unk> -- five percent of the 300 percent of the 300 is 15 people. That's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out <unk> <unk> by the drug that helps you help the drug to help you help the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say you must have to have this conversation with your doctor.
Your medical ethics does need, is a part of the informed consent <unk>
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air value value, but actually this number you have to treat it is quite typical.
For the surgery that you get it more in the <unk> older men -- <unk> prostate cancer, number you need to deal with <unk>
That's -- 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can ask for the conversation before you go forward.
You don't have to make all of this all in the act.
And they also want to think of the quality of life.
Because you have a number of times you have a lot of more times, you want a more short life of pain, or more long than it could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least one of you in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> with a predator, is not necessary to be the <unk> system or the immune system, or the immune system, because if the body is spending on those things, not react very quickly. They could get to be lunch lunch.
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going through the window for those moments of stress is the logical thinking, like Danny <unk> and their colleagues have been shown.
So we have to be <unk> to think about the future kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We all are going to fail and then.
The idea is to think of the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or stop that things bad in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with a combination of a combination of the door with a key to the front door of the input in the itself, an easy way.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I still have had lots of cards that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play a <unk>
Two <unk> <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there, you see it no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> you can never be <unk>
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, and also a little bit of my story.
The language of French signs came during the 1800, and over the time, it was mixed with local signs and developed the language that we know what we know as a <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and taught me that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true that it's really not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a world of sound, is like I lived in a foreign country, just as if I lived in a foreign country following blindly and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like this.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people failed.
So let me learned, for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat from the bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think on the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm <unk> <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting with the sound to the sound of the sound that is to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But for me, to do the same with my thumb that doesn't make it feel natural.
That's why in my drawings -- I have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited in museums and different spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called <unk>
There was no visual art was all <unk>
Now sound has come into my art territory <unk>
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be that way.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that so well that not just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
And I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> a social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be used to me and my artistic work, or my artistic work, or I could be <unk>
I chose it to me.
There's a massive culture around human language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, and the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can be support of the same way and become my voice.
And that way I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, a lot of different performers in <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and <unk>
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
That's being able to ask <unk> their voices, and their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of courage to be a very high interest rate.
If you don't continue with this practice, I feel you might be able to do it in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new medium art medium is in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and will fully express on the paper.
And the same can be in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can actually affect the whole meaning as much as the signals of the sounds.
I would like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to get better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in a lot of <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger as you touch the piano, like facial expression, the speed, the way you get the piano -- English is a linear a linear a linear language, as if you just <unk> it at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need to be 10 fingers <unk> to express a concept of <unk> or an idea of <unk>
If you just would change the <unk> I would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of the <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters are <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I look at the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all the day."
If you <unk> and <unk> the visually speed, the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say that the same thing can be <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed time in <unk> and how distance into body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> -- it's two hands -- the present is two <unk> and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and a very romantic idea at the time, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think, automatically I think automatically in <unk>
Look at <unk> right hand on a right hand right hand.
We have the <unk> across the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of the hands.
Now we're going to do that both in your head like your chest, something like a <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you this this: Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, <unk> Please <unk> again.
And over again.
Is it <unk> <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and Muslims like music.
But today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound automatically -- it doesn't have social value.
We need to start to question what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this might be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn -- you don't have to learn the music.
The <unk> is a <unk> and I'd like to have the same experience.
I would like to be able to open your ears, open your ears open your eyes, to get into your visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, <unk>
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you make it all, but then you have to be <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a hacker bubble, or a bubble bubble <unk> I mean, because adults are lied to us to protect ourselves from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that the adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good for the other ones.
The time country, now now I'm adult and teaching citizenship and invention of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot of for my students to walk on the beach <unk> with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, we clean the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and it's not getting alcohol, and it is not <unk>
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming up with these big <unk> and networks, to gather those bits of plastic them to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But hard for eternity and it's very expensive and it's very <unk> and it's very <unk>
So together with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work with <unk> so that the kids very <unk> also can participate.
And I will tell you the kids that manipulate the electrical tools are really cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I'll leave you to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to make it in something that we hope it to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children would get a lot with the robots.
And then we created what we call "a <unk> <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and <unk> light bulbs and <unk> on a floating <unk> moving water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the <unk> of the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board and measure the size of every particle, to get an estimate of the size of the plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would be able to do it.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to get it immediately.
<unk> to investigate my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that is <unk> is the water that you get <unk> the water where you're living where the water is where you're living where you live.
You can also see the water is brown, and the oil and the oil are brown and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We build a very first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that make the different spectra <unk> which can be <unk>
We <unk> this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and to help other other children.
<unk> to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I was forced to go a little bit more far, and maybe to address a more difficult problem, and closer to me.
I'm half a Japanese half a <unk> and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that a lot of a giant waves called <unk> <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power central to water.
And today, according to the reports about 300 tons of 300 tons is leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific is traces of traces by the <unk>
If we go on the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most radiation of the radiation disappeared the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has certainly got blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've become a <unk> every year from the crash and research, <unk> with other scientists, the land, and this is the river, and we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course they didn't <unk> the parents yet.
But every night we go to the center of <unk> here is the use of different <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to be living with <unk> all their life.
Along with them, we discuss the <unk> data, and we talk about what we were going to do next, and the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time of the <unk> and <unk> water data to simulate the rain.
So with this, we were able to notice that the powder will be <unk> from the summit of the mountain of the mountain of mountain towards the <unk> <unk>
It was an estimate <unk>
But based on this, we organized an civil expedition to the nuclear central central to the date.
We zoom in until 1.5 miles of the nuclear <unk> and with the fishermen of the area were collecting the sea <unk> with a sediment of sediment as we invent and we built and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies very simple.
But at the same time, it's become more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the jump and try to invent it more ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit smaller, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood metal, chemistry -- a bit of biology, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
So for example.
Or we can help for the mobility population, transforming their <unk> chairs in new autonomous vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> they are terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We can't be able to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, <unk> creators, we need to prepare for the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk> <unk>
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing I thought it would be.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk> <unk> tool.
But the living things aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, cells, cells, we have all the information to do it for every cell to work and get them to <unk>
The tools also have the consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has mastered been dominated by manufacturing and production and mass.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world in fact, <unk> the world of assembly -- the <unk> imagination of designers have been able to think their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of material material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial views are thin with <unk> pores are <unk>
And the <unk> tears are more thick with little <unk>
You actually acts as a <unk> which is mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that is gradually that its functionality gradually through the variation.
Here is a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- which represents my view of the world in the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the machine now and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between the Henry Ford -- Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world and the right hemisphere of my left analysis, and intense and synthetic hemisphere shows in two screens after me.
My work, in his simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly growth.
You probably ask yourself, Why now?
Why wasn't it possible that 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment where four disciplines that are offering designers that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We can design objects, products, structures and tools across scale, through scale, as this robotic arm, that one day not very distant to print buildings and graphic buildings, the nanoscale made of <unk> <unk> <unk>
So here we <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the old Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every <unk> is the only size to model light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> -- they're <unk> it's like a second <unk> skin <unk>
Along with 3D printing <unk> 3D printing, we print this layer and <unk> 3D and show you more objects like that.
This <unk> combines <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical <unk> and the <unk> instruments allows us to design the way of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a <unk> <unk> chair the <unk> <unk>
Professor Carter and my collaborator, <unk> <unk> <unk> nature to be <unk> and designing this <unk> pattern.
We would have this surface of 44 different properties of <unk> which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> on the blood body.
Their surface, as in nature, vary their functionality is not through the addition of another material or the other <unk> but continuously <unk> the material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them I got to define a lot of what it is.
Like she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree -- there would be no difference between the trunk, and the leaves <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, cortex, <unk> <unk> <unk>
The earth created a world made a world.
I often ask me, "What would be the design if the objects came out of a single story.
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the material that the kind of material is the kind of material that is the <unk> <unk> material and we found it.
The second more abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year per organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think if we could tune their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> -- a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
We <unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to get a wide range of <unk> from dark, <unk> and <unk> and soft and soft, <unk>
To print the structures at a large scale, they built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made of a single <unk> <unk> <unk> structures -- 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves a dry way to find a natural way to contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process that were used for <unk> <unk> <unk> that first time on the planet <unk> <unk> billion years ago, we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we <unk> bacteria designed to capture carbon out of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition transition without problems, and if it extends more more than windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
So working with an old material, one of the first forms of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water biology, and with a bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed in the sea, <unk> the <unk> life and placed on the soil, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothing for the <unk> <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their <unk>
So like the <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of new life forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of the synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- it was just that <unk> metals are biological within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk> <unk>
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> <unk> bacterium that <unk>
And it turns out the light in sugar, the other one is <unk> and produces some useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
It was never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel, which is a single channel, which is to help the flow of these bacteria and the <unk> function of the way.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material as well.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we have more transparent.
This <unk> system is <unk> when you fall from one end to another, <unk> 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut intestine began.
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures.
What if the design is the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't make it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture in which a home <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in <unk>
One acts like a structure, the other is a structure, or the matrix, the <unk>
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first set up in the environment, creates a tension, structure, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two of the two forces of life, are present in a single material.
With the order to understand better how this complex process works -- we put a little magnet on the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with laser sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and to visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of silk.
But when you put the silk worm worm in a flat patch of flat doesn't within a box, we realized that we would have a cocoon and still <unk>
So we started to design different in different ways, different <unk> and found that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is <unk> directly by the environment.
They often <unk> these silk worms in their <unk> their <unk> their silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we design these <unk> we can give you a way to <unk> silk <unk> just <unk>
They are <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms towards more dark parts and <unk> so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and the heat sets of silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked them silk worms of silk online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to deal with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as long as they <unk> they were <unk> and the life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By the <unk> biological silk of <unk> <unk> -- they give all this <unk>
And in some more than two or three weeks, you know, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length length of the silk pathway.
<unk> after <unk> they produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> <unk> through a robotic arm, the other other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give the products of the products that the buildings around us, to be around -- to form an ecology of materials, designers must bring these two visions of materials, designers must bring these two visions of <unk>
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us from a design inspired by nature to an nature inspired by the first time, that we make us for the first time.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you have ever wondered "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old I had to remember when they asked this?
You can be <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you want to be <unk>
Some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school he liked the English and <unk> and art and the art and <unk> websites -- and so I played the guitar in a punk band called <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And generally I like trying to try and persist anyway, and I have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, it is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it again.
But then I kind of <unk> something totally different, and it was just a different thing -- and I'm going to get me to absorb and I feel <unk> I found the <unk> and then then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it again.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this stuff into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions and <unk>
The other reason that caused me so many anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I worried that something wrong with something bad in this, and something bad at me.
I was worried worried about engagement, or whether or not to be <unk>
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to have been raised then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to themselves, where they learned how bad or abnormal do things.
I'm going to tell you where it <unk> they learned about culture.
You ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody matters what they were going to do.
This is considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is a question over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> students to high school students -- you ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before you get the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, is not inspired by dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does right the point right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't do you to do -- you can't answer with 20 different things, even if you get a <unk> say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk>
You have to be <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and he's <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But that's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something that we are going to spend during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and spend your life on it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that shows you what if there are different issues that you want to do?
There's no place for somebody like you in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling that there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so say.
It could help if you divide it if you divide it for three sides to the potential and <unk>
You can use other kinds of terms of the same idea, as <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was that I was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You have any term you like or <unk> you your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot be according to a single identity.
It's easy to look at the <unk> as the limitation or <unk> that you have to win.
But what I've learned by talking about people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three <unk> <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields that we do of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and Rachel Rachel <unk> -- and their shared interests of data, driving mathematics and design research, mathematics and <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
To <unk> and Rachel Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening on intersections.
This is the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their <unk> can be access to a lot of these points of intersection.
The second <unk> <unk> is fast.
When we <unk> we get into something, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> so many times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of proving new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area and so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time writer and independent <unk>
As a child pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the faster <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was planner, it was <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when their practices, and this ability to write it helps to write <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's rarely a loss of time to go to what you do -- even if at the end of it, even if you <unk> it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other a textbook <unk> website, sometimes I learn from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because he can take a lot of <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Magazine Company defines adaptability as the most important ability to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations who are the individuals who can be able to meet the needs of the market needs.
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encourage people to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need complex creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in their specialists.
<unk> the belly of knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry. There's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make a <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> can dive deep and put in practice, ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful <unk>
But we should all be designing lives and careers that we do with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of the <unk> they are more like their <unk>
I once said this, if there is one thing you can take from this talk, and I hope that it's this: I hope that it is to be in the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart, then if you're a heart, then <unk> all the media.
That's where you get the best of them.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes, and I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep his curiosity in <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads us to a more authentic life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
Within a woman in <unk> a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until sadly, passed away away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> he did a <unk> and found <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a guy that had never seen.
I'm even more amazing.
If I would have been living today, we could have been living today, we couldn't give it more helps her than he was <unk> he gave her years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that now we call disease.
Since <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They've found antibiotics and vaccines vaccines to protect ourselves from the infections, a lot of treatments for the cancer, <unk> for the <unk> and so much more.
But shortly has been moved in the treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for a decade ago.
So I think about this all the time.
<unk> affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million of you.
If they expect to live the 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's is almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the probability of their <unk> of Alzheimer's disease or helping care to a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
Not only in the United States, care about Alzheimer's billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent in disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a five percent increase in the year 2050, as older as the generation of <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little in <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's other diseases, because we've spent less time and money on the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more than the cancer research research that is in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes of annual deaths of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources has to be more fundamental causes of consciousness.
Because this is what little people you know, but all the <unk> world is a disease, and we can be <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, even scientists, Alzheimer's scientists, with aging.
We thought to be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy brain brain <unk> in the comparison to see the physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to <unk> a severe memory and mental <unk> damage to the disease caused by Alzheimer's Alzheimer's percent expectancy of life and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> <unk> strangers in the <unk> brain ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper it folds like a origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds all right, these <unk> points, end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points stay on the outside.
This makes a protein molecules <unk> each other, forming a groups that can be large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients in Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and there's a lot of steps, and what step is complex is complex, as a bomb.
A <unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the <unk> <unk>
You have to find the right step going on and then to create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part of the majority have gone down the wires and so on.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physical, engineers and <unk>
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that you block specifically to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when these drugs were <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move.
These worms on the other parts, have molecules on protein molecules that they stick with each other inside of them like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in a early stage, then we see that a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope real what it can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome the hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me.
We must be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and pressure on government, and drug drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward in HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to beat the cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk to themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of caregivers of their loved ones day -- and night, they're often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
<unk> is not most of a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients as <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
And I <unk> this article in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in January <unk>
To love with someone, you do this.
The article about a spiritual study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience as we test it in the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strange and more weird questions, to make 36 questions and more personal questions and then both you look at the eyes without talking for it for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which is that would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you <unk> to someone else.
And <unk>
We <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really kind of <unk> Tell your partner what you like him or it, and it was very honest this time, at this time, and I gave you things that you would not say to someone you've just ever known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a little detail a few years ago, <unk> that two of the participants in the participants had married six months after and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So, I was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the time that I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect it.
But nevertheless, we had a good story, and  And I thought that it was a good story, so I send it to a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you probably probably ask you a few of you probably <unk> them.
And the reason I believe that you are challenging this is because I've done this question over and over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before I was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working in an romantic book in the last few years, so I had been able to write about my experience about my romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry of blog can come to a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times is probably a thousand thousands of view.
And that has a good burden of attention to attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was released on Friday one on the night, and already Saturday, Saturday, that happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had been called <unk>
In a month in a month, the article got over eight million <unk> and I was, by saying something, a little <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with birth to own <unk> <unk> but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been an international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were doing the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was cooking this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox in my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were students and journalists and strange strangers like this.
I was interviewed by the radio and <unk>
But even I gave a talk, and a woman yelled at the stage, and a woman laughed at the stage, "Hey <unk>
And I immediately found red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people comfortable in your relationship in an international diary.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times was an article <unk> in San <unk> that included experiences at readers with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said that not every request that both made a public emergence together.
He <unk> TV interviews, and he refused to have pictures of them.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- a range of which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people I didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it really was to be able to make love that it is, if it was able to make love <unk> -- not just an adventure, but love to <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel that I was able to respond.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt about everything, people made the wrong question.
How do you know whether or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of these 36 questions so interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same studio in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher wasn't producing romantic love.
Instead of looking for it, I was looking for <unk> students in college students, using what he was called called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic <unk> right?
But the study did work.
The participants more they felt closer to doing it, and we also used the <unk> <unk> protocol of <unk> as a quick way protocol to create trust and <unk>
They have used that between members of the police and community, and they've used it between people of the opposite policies.
The original version of the history of history, which I proved last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately, never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little bit of a liberal arts university, and then a student came up with me and he told me the studio and tried the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say you love with the person who owns it.
Well he made a <unk>
I think she only wants us to be friends.
I said, "Well, they got better friends?
<unk> who did they get better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that this was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had that relationship since I had 20, which I was not all my adult life, and what he was all my adult love, and he had no idea how or if she could live without it.
So I brought to science in science.
And I did everything that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a kind of <unk>
I don't know if I realized this at the time I had just done for the book I had just done for the book to write but in retrospect, it really seems to be <unk>
I thought that if they built the romantic love, the romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I was then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one another.
I am more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what it is.
But I can also get me more clearly, and I can tell you that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than what you do to do with me.
What I'm looking for love is a voice, not only about being loved today and to be loved tomorrow, but from the person that I love that I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some way to be able to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that is, they still follow together?
And their content with an answer of yes.
So more than a question, <unk> that make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How to stay in love when things become <unk> and how to know when they cut and <unk>
How do you live in uncertainty that inevitably leads to you, or more how you live in your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more controversial conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, you know, is <unk> a year ago, and I was able to apply a study designed to create romantic love, we <unk> we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that will be <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> The love didn't happen.
We <unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not really not true, but because at the moment, there was no thing that was supposed to be was that there was no thing that was supposed to be.
I didn't want to have a few times we would have that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always bought me or not.
I want to be done enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, and I have chosen to love someone as generous, as generous, and <unk> someone in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really think of it.
And what we <unk> and what I might spend my life looking for is that the myth is true.
I want the happy end of my article implicit in the title of my paper, which is the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk>
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian in full mountain, and in a way I came as a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York City is a time a time ago --  -- something that really struck me but more <unk>
I will start to start when I was eight years old.
And I took a wooden box and I took a dollar, and you put a dollar, a pen and a fork in the somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later, and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it is <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment since I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all those things, and I was doing a dream.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a sort of <unk> <unk> and I had a sort of <unk> <unk> I covered my <unk> and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to bees, and it's <unk> and so I added to them, so I added more <unk>
Instead, it happened. In some way the opposite of the <unk> in a way it seemed to be a matter of size, as if it was to be a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add electronic elements on, strange bottles that I was finding down the street, everything that I could find, because I was looking for things all my whole life, trying to figure out the stories of these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow and draw you just drawing a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took out the objects and I set up the objects and created my own <unk>
First of all, you get a idea.
Then I did some insects and some strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some of some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was cool, man. It was nice.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, a <unk> sculptures of natural size drawings into layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I am <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because I was the <unk>
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers that glass, I started to draw in a window and then another window and another window, and I had all these windows together which are a three-dimensional composition of a three-dimensional composition of a <unk>
And this really works -- and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, for years, and my <unk> work with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, that's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It's twice a face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
The left on the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures <unk> animals between two worlds.
They go from the <unk> world to this <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here is where the heads of animals are run by the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god <unk> <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> -- there are all kinds of weird things that Osama bin Laden's and very well in the ocean.
It's also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits oil into a hand while the other hand goes out of the other hand out of the other hand out of your hand.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> which keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird, like a bird <unk> and spits it out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> a snake <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, in any rate, his tail turn fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that do things you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made terrorist cards from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
<unk> to their time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material -- dictionaries are <unk>
But each one of you as a kind of archive in a way of a human <unk> and travel groups and 12 or 12 to once.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being trapped in their inside.
This has a small cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to stand for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall and you have a waterfall and you cover your penis or whatever you have a <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't do it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body of half.
This has two heads and is communicating between the two.
There are some pills that they come out and come in the head of this strange statue and go into this <unk>
There's a little piece of the forest within the <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> It's a <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> a museum, a museum, a museum, a museum, a museum, a museum, a museum radio, a school, a <unk> arm, a garden.
We <unk> the box and all the people in affecting each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box is that it is living in the world.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this delusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, don't work.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we didn't start to exchange those things with sweet <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill is that this pill is against pain, first passes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
I'm going to take a pill is effective and <unk> so that any drug drugs effect on your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take <unk> drugs that are to lower the amount of viruses in your blood, you increase the stem cells.
But they are also known by their side effects on their negative side effects because of the negative, because in time it takes it to get into the <unk> <unk> they <unk> and worse -- even for the time to get it to their destiny, which is where it's more important, in the warehouse <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the blood stream of patients in the drug drug drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV with the current drugs that is a treatment of life that is <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment of the virus, directly to the <unk> risk of <unk>
As a scientific <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery surgery can be used for diabetes, you can use it for any <unk>
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser pulses to open or <unk> and <unk> extremely small, <unk> cells with HIV to introduce drug drugs.
They ask the best you ask, "How do that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cell cell infected cell -- while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, whereas the cell is through the cell, whereas the cell is to absorb the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We are now testing this technology in vitro or <unk> of <unk> but the goal is to lead this technology into human body, apply to the human body.
"How do that <unk> you can ask you questions.
Well, the answer is, through a three <unk> device.
With the first -- which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which is a drug -- the <unk> it takes it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser used to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total <unk> of HIV <unk>
Yeah. It's a cure for HIV.
This is the whole dream of <unk> <unk> in our case, a laser <unk>
Thank you.
Over the last decade, in the last decade, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
And so what these groups do these groups when they're not shooting at <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these generators agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition of violent participation to the confrontation not violent.
I do work in the field of the politics of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost all conflict conflict all, because the war has changed.
It used to be an dispute between states.
Not not.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors are not government actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed by a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> even we must be <unk> or <unk> in any <unk>
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why you do it, how do they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and politics is not armed <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known by his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the decade in the 1980s, <unk> also established a political game, a network of social services.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known by their suicide attacks against Israel, by the government of Gaza as well.
So these groups make more than just to fire.
They're multitasking indeed.
It <unk> a complex machine network communication stations radio, TV channels online and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine <unk> and published <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising funds, but through business <unk> for example, manufacturing companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something more more more that they create the population of their population to investing in social services.
They build schools, run schools, put a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering people something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The <unk> of Taliban in Afghanistan by war or even the <unk> principle of <unk> it can be able to understand the efforts of these groups for safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling up a <unk> a gap <unk> by the government, and allow them to take these groups and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006, the Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and give the governance.
And the more complex and the more sophisticated organizations, are these organizations, we can be <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all of your <unk> collect all the <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
Or maybe it's something else something new and a different thing again.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, nations without state, and the more weak the states are states, like the Middle East in the Middle East and <unk> that gap is <unk>
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups groups will have to invest more in the military <unk>
<unk> that <unk> the government is to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace to peace.
If we understand more of groups groups -- we understand better what incentives can be to foster violence transition to violence violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, actors to military power can make a few fights, but we don't give peace and stability.
To achieve these goals that we need long-term investments to fill that of security security, to fill that of the government <unk> that allowed these groups to thrive at a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a <unk>
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to embrace the openly <unk> label <unk>
I'm a <unk>
And therefore I was being surprised as a feminist <unk>
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews that people started to call <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a personal <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had some strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and who hated sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular as a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was being aware of the <unk> that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that might be a feminist that could
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> an unpleasant <unk>
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is a very high purpose to believe that it's equal or a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that he actually is that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, as I grew up, and I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel the world as a <unk> of <unk> violence.
We have right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we have to have on our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body expression and gender of religion and <unk> and it <unk>
We have to have to realize these differences and how we do it in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
To me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I am a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I went to work, I listen to rap music, rap music to volume.
Although the letter degrades to women and offends me, the classic <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the Yin is incredible.
Do you actually get your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> I am in my musical practice.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is everything I don't want to do -- <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I don't want anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color my favorite one.
It <unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice thing.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> of the <unk> fairy tales that they make a reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to take to adopt the last last name is his husband, and I am not who I am at <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I hate that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are becoming economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> which has historically ignored or <unk> the needs of color women and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist
It also happens the following.
We have this tendency to <unk> <unk>
We hope that we would not expect it to be right.
When we <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to be <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put it there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, they're afraid to be <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> for fear that means that <unk> <unk> <unk> meant not to be able to fulfill with realistic.
Let's take a <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist here.
In the <unk> Music <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk> seeing this star <unk> embracing feminism and to know the women and the young men and the young men who are a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started endless debates whether or not the feminist was not really <unk>
I would get his feminism, rather rather than the word of an adult woman and <unk>
We are pretty much about the <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go much beyond <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or more good, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the day, and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happily providing an <unk> <unk>
These artists will not change their way of talking about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music have been so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions do this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve us, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
Those are the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option to be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television TV program, as the sexual violence against women as sports, and <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear the songs as anything.
We can spend our money to go to film to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than as <unk>
We can stop support sports professionals where athletes deal with their <unk>
In any case, men, especially <unk> men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't take it a number of enough women, so much to be involved as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these sorts of projects, we can also be able to get them to overcome including as much as we were to overcome decisions.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little <unk> acts of courage and hope that our decisions are going to be the <unk> people in power and music, <unk> and music, <unk> -- the people who can make great decisions the more courageous, decisions to make a lasting lasting change.
We can also be able to tell us with bravery our question, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my <unk> <unk> <unk> says, <unk> is a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because I was <unk> my voice was stolen and feminism helped me.
There was one incident.
I call it an incident in order to address what happened.
A few kids <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't get to believe that it could be something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me, and they understood what meant live in this world if you have brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the script and I also discovered that if it was a little brave other woman I found -- and see me and realize that none of us is anything that the world is nothing that the world tries to tell us that none of us, is the nothing that the world is about us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything else.
And on the other, I actually have a <unk> reality that I'm a woman.
I am a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I say and what I mean.
I hope that we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we all can be a little bit <unk> when you get a little bit <unk> when you get a little bit more courageous, when you need a little bit more courageous, when you need a little bit more courageous, when you need a little bit more courageous, when you need a bit of a bit of a bit more courageous, when you need a little bit of
Just after Christmas year, <unk> kids in California had <unk> to have been <unk> and by being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be fatal for a child with a immune system with immune system, is one of the most powerful diseases.
There is an effective vaccine against this more than the more than the more than a half a century ago, but a lot of the kids involved in the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to even be familiar with.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical <unk>
They don't believe most smart scientists than the theory that vaccines cause the autism is a <unk>
I believe that most of you know, but millions of parents all around the world continue to <unk> which vaccines will have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase autism estimates over time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered very rare.
The few psychologists and convinced that I had heard about her creating a whole professional life without just just a case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence followed stable three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising <unk> as <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as autism as as if he could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you aren't the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control -- what's going on, tend to based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis and "a better <unk> of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of <unk> language fears of a young woman who looks for a young woman who is looking for his child in his <unk>
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why did the autism cases so hard to find before the <unk> <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened less than to do with the slow progress and <unk> of science that the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is a story about what the autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be a devastating impact on global public health and the consequences of the same as well.
There was a second more accurate history of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could be fun for hours by waving hands in their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> like when they didn't put his favorite toy in their usual place.
On the basis of patients being treated in their clinic, the <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the topic, I found that I had seen less than 150 case cases of your syndrome as an <unk> of places as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis of children with <unk> but now we know that the epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned to nine other 10 children sent by other doctors to his doctor's office, not to give them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> child caused by cold <unk> and <unk>
These kids, he said, have they kept very carefully in a fridge that was not <unk>
At the same time, yet, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients who had special skills that they put in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records of his favorite record. He said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were simply saying that the kids were simply <unk> what had heard their approval to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in the world.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband and her husband was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as a child as black-eyed Susie, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to stand for the National School of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their family families, and their colleague, Judith decided to do something that was done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence in autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw -- clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the fact of autism was much more <unk> and diverse the fact it was much more <unk>
Some kids couldn't talk at all, whereas others who were <unk> in their fascination with the <unk> in the dinosaurs or the <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as <unk> said and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of the <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the <unk> item on the next year to the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article by the competition, but I avoided my own job.
There was not even a translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he was German <unk> and he <unk> it for her.
The document is an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children with learning kids were <unk> even for the <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, they started with music, and the kids kept their games on their <unk>
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as a <unk> disability described as disability <unk> <unk> space for the course of the whole life.
Instead of trying to treat kids in their clinic as patients as their little teachers, and he brought them to help the development of methods of education that were especially right.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse diverse <unk> that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> <unk> in <unk> culture like the awkward social scientist.
He was beyond even to say, that for the success of science and art, one about autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> and as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American <unk> Association to expand the criteria of the diagnosis of what they called <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad <unk>
These changes not <unk> <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked among them to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult people.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, a little bit of <unk> <unk> by experts knew what the autism, <unk> <unk> and the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition -- <unk> with four <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what it was to be autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that tiny little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> the changes in the <unk> and the introduction of these tests created a <unk> a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> they expected that it was to make the people that with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame vaccines to vaccines vaccines -- a simple, <unk> <unk> and <unk> work as bad as the <unk> <unk>
If the current estimate of prevention of prevention -- one of their 68 children in the United States are right in the spectrum, is the <unk> groups of the world.
In the last few years, people <unk> people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that they're the puzzles for the new medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand the <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows -- it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> -- and it suffers from a attention deficit to <unk>
No doubt, human people have a lot of hard people to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that the <unk> aspects of the most autism aspects of them are in the understanding of teachers, employers who are with ability, and parents to support the potential for their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands in cover to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
As we moved into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges we face as society.
We can't afford to afford to have a brain.
Thank you.
