You know what I do is write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, and, in fact, I'm the author for the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want like a scientist.
I can be <unk> like farmer, or <unk> clothes, and never nobody has chosen for a farmer.
I'm here to talk today about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> generally is something that you fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back into the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine made that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle of the middle school, in <unk> <unk> where I was the rare of the class.
And when she was beaten up to bleed every week in the kids, until she saved a teacher to saved his life.
She saved my life when I could go into the <unk>
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, 85 dollars, 85 dollars, and I ended up at San Francisco, found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to begin to work in organizations who fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call phone in the middle of the night I got a phone call phone that he said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never get to us.
You could be <unk> and please bring that man that I know you've seen.
And I must tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to get you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went off to see, <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and we take care of her family, because it was necessary, and we get to get out of his family, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult the adult became a box of <unk> it became a <unk>
And what happened was that the circle had closed, had turned into a circle -- and that <unk> that he talked to him in itself.
<unk> is that death part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the <unk> of it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> around the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and I was not able to think that it was a <unk> of snow <unk> <unk>
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or the break off the ice walls.
Every single iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with its environment and their experiences.
Some of them are <unk> and they hold off to the end, whereas others in the end, so many people can't get them more and <unk>
It's easy to think about a <unk> which are isolated <unk> and alone, as we see it as we see it as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> of <unk> I'm breathing his ancestral <unk>
As a <unk> iceberg releases sweet water that that feeds many forms of life.
I get to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits -- as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, that knowing that it again.
It's not the death of the <unk> it's not an end, it's not an end, but a continuation next one of its way by the life cycle of life.
Part of the ice of <unk> <unk> is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures that I'd like to show you are a <unk> iceberg I photographed in <unk>
It's a little bit frequent to get a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I would like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its <unk> line.
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, right at the same time, every one -- a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much of the details of the conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of yes, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And in this scenario I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and sperm <unk>
And in the other case, the X <unk> chromosome in the X <unk>
Both of them and it starts life.
We'll go back to them later.
And in my ground activity turned on two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with anatomy.
I'm a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way that people came up with the anatomy -- to the anatomy -- human bodies -- how many human bodies have been considered the body fluid -- what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance of my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients -- or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> <unk> people who are doctors.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people within a single body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of many cases of people with <unk> sex individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit in the male <unk>
And in general, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples of some ways that you have a sex that are not <unk> in the common form of a <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose chromosome <unk> the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life.
And then, in life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual is no receptors in testosterone, the body is not reacting to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome is <unk>
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, a body that is in a <unk> <unk>
When you <unk> the baby has a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast, but it doesn't have the menstrual period is going on.
And then they tried to get testing that instead of having a <unk> and <unk> actually <unk>
What's important to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> <unk>
Most women as I -- I was -- I don't know the <unk> structure, and I think to be a typical woman that I think is a typical woman in most of women like me.
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me have the most exposed brain <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> which has <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of a way you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 19-year-old who was born and raised <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, and I had just found that I had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had chromosomes and the <unk> glands were so active -- that in basically created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> nothing.
And it was the 19 years when she started having medical problems caused by internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman.
Well, another quick example of <unk>
Some people with the brain chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue tissue wrapped in <unk>
We don't know why that.
So there are lots of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- so that they are <unk> twins <unk> <unk> twins <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they <unk> a number of surgeries that are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea of usually in the idea of a particular anatomy by a particular treatment.
We have the idea that will be a woman that is to have a <unk> identity <unk> being black wants to have African anatomy in terms of the historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you put a body that shows you something quite different, you have a lot of problems with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
So imagine how amazing that is to have children that are born of children that are born in a very body.
The greatest case is the past year with <unk> South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the heart of trial in <unk>
A lot of journalists who were called to wonder: "What do they test to be able to figure out if <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you the journalists who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that you have to admit that nature, we don't plot a line of <unk> between men and women or between men and <unk> and <unk> we are the ones who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation in which the more importantly, the more we have to admit that these categories where the more of us -- we thought were a stable little stable that becomes <unk> directly with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the <unk>
So as we go into it, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA <unk>
What do we <unk> the fact from them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science, we get more and more and more of a <unk> zone that we have to recognize that <unk> categories.
And we're looking at this in all the <unk> of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions in the day today not in public, but in the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to get it with this question, if anybody was dead.
As a lot of him to put a little pen in front of his nose, and if he was still not <unk>
If I stopped moving it.
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put it on another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of really figuring out the death, which is actually a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And perhaps think that this explosion of categories could be celebrating someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, I'm going to the people with different bodies, but I have to admit that I nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought of.
It will come from the point of view from the point of view.
And to tell you this tension -- first I have to admit that I'm a fervent <unk> <unk> I'm a fervent <unk> <unk>
I know that they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and <unk> in what they did, that I find myself so that I found myself watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
It's what happened in <unk> with <unk> <unk> with <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was to me, the first few activists in the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old people in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea.
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be the political power of the <unk> the father and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the field of play, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk>
And in part they were doing because they're a part of a <unk> system, where they were doing two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear of course, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of the <unk> <unk> from a <unk> idea.
They were moving toward a <unk> concept.
And if you look -- for example, the Declaration of <unk> <unk> talk about nature and <unk>
You don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And on a consequence that we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, and saying, "I'm a man."
And again, as a new color people <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking questions why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights of a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> by anatomy.
I don't want to say that five years of five years to allow them to have sexual relationships.
There are some <unk> little <unk> which for me have a sense of <unk>
But the challenge is to try to discover what they are, why do they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> things at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, injustice was born three months before time: June the June June 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, on the contrary, was born in term: I was born a March <unk>
So by the fact that there was three months born three months before Mary attribute to every three months before Henry <unk> the right -- the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry needs to wait for all of that not because it is not because it has a different age, but because was born.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered -- if I didn't tell you if it's <unk> by virtue I haven't told if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered <unk>
<unk> for its hand, does not have the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry may get married in every single states, with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So we still have a <unk> categories that in various ways that it is <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is: What do we now do now that science moved so much in the field of anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science.
Where do we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude of <unk> "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere.
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man with a man doesn't have to have a <unk> and to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now in practice they don't make tests of the people.
But this is also very strange in the history of the history of <unk> syndrome that I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems very <unk>
But how do you do that?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we had to deal with this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> that some humans that I know.
I also want to say that perhaps some <unk> that I know that you can make more intelligent <unk> intelligent decisions about their sexual <unk> who I know.
So how do we put the theme content on <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character in a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to do that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to drive this current of thinking of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to other men is susceptible to to be <unk> and in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm so happy to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple years ago that a couple of years ago that he had made a couple of <unk> twins after that.
But when the phone asked him the reason for the operation, I was very <unk> operation, he said in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has been considered the political asylum rather than <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who who are without a lot of the state.
So I think we have to be a <unk>
Well, to finish the end to just to say, I've been talking about <unk>
And I want to think of how it would be a democracy, or like it could have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say a little bit radical for a <unk> and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming out from different <unk> <unk> in particular if people are thinking about groups.
For years old, given that I've been interested in <unk> I have been interested in doing the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk>
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my <unk> I was who I was interested in feminism in feminism -- <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've heard heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of gender, so there is nothing women's <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, the more that I think is a female <unk>
I mean, there could be something on average, a different thing is different between the human brains and the male that makes us more <unk> and complex social relationships to help the more vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way that people are to protect the people in the state, it's possible that have been more <unk> that concept, perhaps we would have enriched the concept of <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we get the democracy beyond <unk> thinking about the individual body in terms of identity, and think about relationships.
So as we try to make a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work at least a bunch of different cities that are competing for them to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're out of that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't tell them a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could use it to the <unk> world maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound <unk> if you never thought about new cities.
But they just <unk> by buildings by apartments.
So imagine that half that you wanted to live in apartments that they would have to live in apartments and that half even the other <unk>
You could try to increase the ability to <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around us are allowed to avoid the <unk>
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go into a completely new place, build a whole new building, new building building, again, always and when the rules of that <unk> it will rather than <unk>
So I proposed that the government <unk> new parts of reform enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities.
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would know that every year to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that these people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional financial crisis.
In the next regular election, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform for which <unk> reforms and in the same time.
He asked <unk> who was his <unk> <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with <unk> and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk>
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and cry for all the current residents of apartments.
It is a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes a lot of attention to the new technologies for us, and usually they are the rules that keep us going.
At the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December in December we met in Miami, a conference hall.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable cities, more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture showing the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, worth a thousand dollars per square meter.
But it was a rather abstract argument and at some point when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms of very simple a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> a <unk> which is a <unk> which <unk> the rules that people can choose if you want to go or live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> me, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, is important, and said that we had to be doing this project, is important, this could be a path to our <unk>
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about it again.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture of this, which I was trying to explain that it is to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new <unk> the new airport was built in <unk>
Just this airport just cover over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and we have to start with a site that <unk> at least one square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform, and he said, <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can be providing new choices for the people.
There would be one option of a city that you might go could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of <unk> <unk> need help in <unk> countries may benefit from the country associated with them and make the market rules of <unk> so that everyone could be able to rely on the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This is a picture of it.
It could easily have a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and adding a constitutional <unk> that would allow you to create these special regions.
In a country that just just going through this crisis, <unk> voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the place in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass it twice in Congress.
On February 17 is passed another one on the other <unk> <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on 24 to 24 o'clock in February, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is building in North Korea, is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything that you see there was built in four years, after four years getting <unk>
The other interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, it's the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow the Supreme Court to have the ultimate court <unk>
There are urban <unk> in cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know that they have solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are a lot of people that I'd like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately again.
There are one million a year that comes out from Latin America to go to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to go back to their family to get a job, sometimes they get a job -- sometimes these are <unk> mothers who have to make the money to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some of a decade.
So, what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred across the world?
What does it like to insist for families for families to choose between a number of cities that are competing for new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you for TED 10.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there are inside there, I'm going to make a confession and it is that I live with <unk>
I love to find -- and more recently, to photograph and more recently photograph and more of my blog <unk> <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores to me allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> and in my <unk>
I go to meet people <unk> <unk> and <unk> people, usually my money -- and buy it to be a <unk> personal <unk>
I mean, what are I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I will like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what you <unk> for this exciting week.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I'm suit.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> in exactly a week that's what I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after <unk>
And since I don't know as a woman that walks for TED in <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, or not, and I have learned in this adventure to not use new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people to happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child being inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember her little <unk>
I like <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're good at something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think that you don't do well with something, probably also be true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you believe that you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't look at it that you can't afford it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style -- and only a very good way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried one and over and over and over again when people were approaching this week just because of what we were using.
This is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I left home, I want to donate it to it.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week.
I don't need emotionally to believe these things, because I don't need any other emotionally <unk> and a brilliant <unk> and bright and bright <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split on two parts.
The left side which is the logic and the right side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone that's completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think that most of the members of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a great <unk>
It's not to be mutually <unk>
It can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people, the same as most of the other quantum physicists, we need a rather logical logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we developed our intuition to that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
It's a kind of intuition that you can have developed with the past step past the years is the one thing you can be in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that a thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk>
I remember watching a child on a parking bar at a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet the play bar with that bar bar with that bar <unk> taught a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow them to be <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except you are a physicist.
It would be a terrible model model for a particle physicist -- because they don't play with parking parking little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they do all kinds of things really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all of these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years earlier -- needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But not the needed to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not very often a lot of the particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but sometimes a lot of it.
And I've never seen.
I mean, nobody ever saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't go to the principles of mechanical mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it doesn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
This is why a few years ago, I set up to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first thing you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to a little <unk> little <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little piece of metal, and that is <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so I made this almost the same way that you would have a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a mixed room with a new silicon chip -- and I started to work all the big machines for about about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap in quantum <unk> but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people you get out of doing those things, because I don't want to be doing those things, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects do behave in the same way.
The <unk> <unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, it's the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on the room and the heat of the room.
And so we knew if we wanted this little piece of metal -- according to the quantum mechanics, to push it all the other passenger ones.
And that's what we did.
We <unk> the lights then then take a <unk> and pulled it all the air, and then we put it on a temperature of less than a degree above the absolute zero.
Now when you're just in <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as you like.
So we measure their movements.
We found that he moved in very strange. ways.
Instead of place to stay perfectly still, I was <unk> and the way it <unk> it was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and they didn't get the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm going to tell you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about the atoms.
In a case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal is still that piece of metal and the same time.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time what it means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, and that metal piece can be in two different places.
I mean, this is my logical part of the logic of it.
So imagine if they were in a number of places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you acting your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when it was the <unk> and we turned the lights and look inside the box, and we saw that the metal still in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator on the elevator are actually only quantum objects.
You hear a lot about that a lot of <unk> that quantum mechanics is interconnected.
Well, that's not that truth.
It's more than that, it's more than that, it's more <unk>
That is that those connections, your connections to all the things that are around you, literally define you who you are, and that's the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was a job on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to make it.
It took 18 months to get me 18 and 18 for 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, it was <unk> by 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a bunch of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just an indication that my own story is just this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- I didn't get a lot of access to a lot of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Better to see the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have done since your launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums here.
There's the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to go into one of my favorite, the <unk> the art museum of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top, and you have a click on the top, you jumped inside.
You're inside, you want to go to the end of the room.
Let's go ahead and get <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> from Pieter <unk> at the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of it.
If the museum shows you the image, you click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm clicking here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured what we call the technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get in 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you actually do with 10,000 million <unk>
And it can zoom in around it in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has a price.
But if you really want to get the <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "One moment -- this seems to be <unk>
And I found that the children were actually actually playing with something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people, and I actually found that this is a game called called <unk> which is a <unk> called <unk> which is <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take you a little bit of perspective, and I'm going to go to the image, really, really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So we're going very quickly to jump again at MoMA again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find <unk>
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what van Gogh is actually created by <unk>
It increases and <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is the <unk> <unk> I think I never had seen that before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part is called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that day.
You can online with your own museum to create your own museum from all of these images.
It's very simple, you walk in, I've created this function that I call the power of <unk> <unk> -- we just went out of <unk>
It's about "The <unk> at National <unk>
You can write things, send it to your friends, send it to your friends about what you feel about looking at these <unk> <unk>
So in conclusion, I think that to me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even come out of the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media does have to make justice work for your artwork and that's represented in line.
And the great question that you do today is, you have made this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think about this is a <unk> <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian all the kids in Italy with this picture on your bedroom. But the reason why I show you this is that it has happened to be very interesting -- something very interesting about careers one in the last two decades.
For some time, some time, if you just wanted to win a career of mine, and I took a budget and put it on a nice car and a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough -- you made the career.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, in real time.
It's essentially a system which has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What is interesting today is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They are coming back to the open.
And as <unk> are starting to answer in a different way, and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note of aside I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet but represent 50 percent of the <unk>
75 percent of the <unk> percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> they're entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, in MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way it is as if almost all of all the existing atoms is <unk> sensors and <unk>
And that is changing the interaction as we humans have with the outer environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when <unk> <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end of the <unk> it is actually still the <unk> and he came out of the Moses -- he was still able to see a little <unk> <unk> and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, our first time our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and make something.
Let's start with the detection of <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first of our first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer that was in 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the things remember would play <unk> and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day looking at the activity <unk> on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's tomorrow, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
By the afternoon, early people there are people around here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
They <unk> people a quick call and it goes into the bathroom.
Second time End <unk>
First time <unk> <unk>
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, <unk>
That night they all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the great summit.
And the next day they all went to the center with the <unk> and the prime minister of then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how we can measure the pulse of the city of a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, but about things that we use and consume.
Today we know everything about the source of our objects.
This is a map of all the chips that all the chips that make us all the chips that make it a <unk> how are the <unk>
But we know very little about where things go things.
And so in this project, we developed some little tags that we developed the trash system in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently recently a year more than a year ago, and you can see, sort of different kinds of things, like you can see that.
And then we put a little chip, and then we put a little chip, and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
You look at <unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't even exist.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> not disappears, is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day is still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked at the <unk>
And the first project is something that we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of town, which came up and told us that Spain and the south of Europe has a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology think new technology can come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, it was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with water pixels with water.
If the pixels the pixels can be written in them, show patterns, patterns, a text.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked this.
And we had a commission to design the building to the input of the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no gates no windows, but when you come up and open up so you can happen.
The roof is <unk>
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> <unk>
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there's always going to be someone in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you have <unk> but when almost all the whole architecture goes down.
This is working.
You can see the <unk> people in the <unk>
And here I'm myself trying not <unk> to test the sensors that open water the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all of the sensors stopped working.
That night was really even more fun.
All the <unk> children came to the building because the way we interact had a little bit.
It was not a building that would open you to let you happen, but a building that was still <unk> and a building <unk> and you had to jump up and jump up for you to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of the use of people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to <unk> people that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels of the physical pixels and the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'll show you.
Imagine that the pixels could begin to fly.
So imagine that you could have little <unk> helicopters in the air and that every one had a small pixel in the air, and every one of a small cloud that is moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw before, which moves with each other in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
A flexible screen like this is a flexible <unk> in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, which what changes is light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
So imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that it could be a cloud of pixels in which you can be <unk> and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light, the light, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them with one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, and so forth, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of <unk> from New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements in and use as a entry for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> you see the <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time capture.
It can make it all the movement.
You can go through all the way.
And once we have the pixels of the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of you a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable thing that's happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, moving the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and that's accessible through the Internet.
Today, and for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, from power to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how will happen from digital world.
The idea is that we can make people that it involves doing this together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels of the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but <unk>
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be to share the main moments of the top Olympics.
So that's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, just like a new top of a <unk>
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but most importantly, it will be a new experience for anybody to go to top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, can improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way, to be more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure ourselves?
How about living in good health?
Or maybe be out of those people that they always wanted to be more creative.
What is the <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I was probably to the number of creative people.
That's really good.
How many <unk>
So a few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that is even possible?
Evolution has been a theme here in the TED conference today, but I want to give you a little doctor on the front.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which in the <unk> Church, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote an trial called <unk>
But if they actually accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about other other or ourselves?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, is very well at one end, it is, of course, the more of us.
<unk> of a common ancestor about the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been perhaps 20 or 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some people have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk>
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat it.
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same <unk> but it's the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> which comes out of pancreatic numbers.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the gut of the <unk> cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> they ask them about the <unk> they think of <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully seductive environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm warm is very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that may want without effort.
It's really like a quick piece of the bacteria in the minimum disruption of some rush to the output.
But because of that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what did the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something or better the <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique <unk> and human life, and a little bit of human life.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope that you have <unk>
When I first recently went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell in life, is broadcast and the genetic energy of that cell lives.
But when the <unk> organisms are starting to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that genome, the rest of the body gets <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of death of the body comes into evolution in sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student I was thinking, <unk> <unk> death -- he seemed a lot of <unk> death at that time, but with every year he was born.
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas right now.
And one night somebody hits his hotel door to his hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him finds a magnificent <unk> <unk> <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> in looking for a <unk> <unk>
She said, "Good says, George, I choose the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in disease.
I wanted it to live more and more in a healthier ways.
Evolution consists of going through the genome to the next <unk> "We will change the <unk>
From an evolutionary standpoint, you and I are you as <unk> rockets -- designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then we will fall into the sea.
I believe that all of the feeling that I put in Woody Allen when he said, <unk> I want to get the immortality through my work.
I want you to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily allow for longevity.
It doesn't necessarily allow us to the greatest or the stronger or the <unk> or the <unk>
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there would be fish there that would be such fish there, fish <unk> -- yet they have managed to make a <unk> environment.
So what do this mean when we look at what is happening in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that not <unk>
We have achieved a kind of balance.
And the knowledge that would be that through medicine, in the first place, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we get to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much no longer possible to have the isolation necessary thing to happen.
A second possibility is that it is a second possible evolution -- natural <unk> from nature.
And the argument here is that the <unk> of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when as a species, distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility -- an interesting possibility -- intriguing <unk> intriguing and frightening.
I call the new evolution, which is not just a <unk> but <unk> and chosen for us as individuals in the decisions.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of all, consider the reality that a lot of people today, in some cultures, are being making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing having more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you pick up at the individual at all.
Think also that if it was possible that if we could choose not just the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic change to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's risk or to get rid of the <unk>
You don't want to make the changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future kind of changes to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
At the next year I've finished, in 2004, I could get the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
So today, you can get a full sequence of three three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to 20,000 and a week.
It didn't make a lot of so that the human genome is to make the human genome by <unk> and more to the rest of us.
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin can make viruses that are not only going to protect us, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
You know, or there is no one of the experimental trial an experimental <unk> that with the flu vaccine <unk>
You can imagine a good thing going out of the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only other two tiny <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> egg and to change your children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminate your diabetes to cancer?
Who does not want more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes of diseases, it's going to allow us to also have to adopt <unk> -- <unk> a better memory.
Why do we not have the genius of an Ken <unk> especially if you could be <unk> with the next generation of the machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle to be able to run more quick and more <unk>
Why don't we live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of introducing this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to be the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that typically could take a 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe occur within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren are going to have to do.
We're going to use these choices in which a better society -- more more <unk>
Or we're going to <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything, we are going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 side of heights.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to you about <unk>
So immediately, they looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably get some <unk>
The pilot already had been <unk> and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not <unk>
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being in a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three more <unk> words that you have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more to the <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
Was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before of death, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all people who wanted to come and didn't do it, and I did not do it, all the fences that I wish I wanted to get and never <unk>
As I thought of that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it out.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in the life.
And that urgency, really, has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as long as the bridge George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, <unk> really a great <unk> I feel a great deal.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity it also gives my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time to <unk> in things that don't really work with people who do matter.
And I thought of my relationship with my wife, with my wife with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
Within two years I didn't have a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to get <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental watch <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please go <unk>
I don't want that this is broken in 20 pieces of pieces as you look at those <unk>
And as <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want me to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness would be in a single thought, which is just a thing.
I wish I could see my children to grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- I was not a lot of artistic <unk> --  -- I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave up another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live in again.
You who are flying in today, the challenge you can see that the same thing in your airplane -- and please be -- but imagine, and how do you get it -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is that <unk> that still wait to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would they change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, being the best parents ever <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been in a lot of living with a lot of projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> years.
One day he came home after he got home and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design and an animation company, so that graffiti is something like a graffiti thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk with Tony again.
I just want to communicate with it, and he would be able to communicate with me.
And I said, "A second, I was not that <unk> watching Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate with those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have a very good good, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Anybody to see the film, "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're going to get it with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How do it be?"
So I presented with just the desire to deliver a check, and rather than that he signed a check and instead of a check that was not the least idea of how it was to <unk>
I was <unk> with her brother and his father there at that right moment, "All right, this is the Tony <unk> will be going to build a machine, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's ridiculous to someone that you have so much inside your inner cannot <unk>
So I spoke at a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that can allow you to project a light at any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw on that and record space.
So they go over there making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they are -- they're part of a life cycle.
First they start with sex organs -- then with bad words, after the attacks to Bush and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, about a year later, after a lot later, and so much moving things on one side to another one we achieved a couple of things.
One, we played to the gates of the insurance companies and we get a machine so that they could build a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And, seriously, about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email for him, and you says, "I don't know. This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers out of the whole world <unk> around the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the <unk> and these hackers and programmers and <unk> they took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and very stupid things that when we <unk> it would have taken the walls off the walls and in their place.
But for two weeks of <unk> I went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun <unk> that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, with some copper wire and <unk> <unk> <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light <unk> and now there's a device that's free -- that's free -- and you build one, we published the <unk> <unk> software is low for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say <unk>
There's no hospital to say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using it alone.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you to that.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the end of the <unk>
I love this picture because this is a room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after a year of planning, two weeks of programming programming programming a whole game of the entire night, Tony <unk> to draw in for the first time.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a slide projector on a wall outside of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for the first time his family and friends -- and you can imagine, in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to break it down in the parking lot so we feel like it is as if we were <unk>
By the end of it, he sent us email and this was what he said, "This was the first time that I was in seven years.
I felt like he had been under the water and somebody finally came up with the water and get me out of there so that he could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us on movement.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential it deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how it can make it and make it faster and <unk>
Since we had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the top <unk> of 2010, and was really cool.
The best of this -- and this is what ends up about closing the <unk> is that in April in Los Angeles <unk> in downtown Los Angeles -- is going to have an exhibition called <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> <unk> urban art -- <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, doing possible.
None of what there is in this room could be the stage, the computer, the computer, the <unk> nothing was possible.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with the genomic recognition technology, just I just recognized something and <unk> with amazing people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find ourselves when we find ourselves every day when we find that something that we feel like to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years, in situations generally very difficult and very hard at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
They are in <unk> difficult zones and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating a lot of fun on the very beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been <unk> in situations like horrible with the only goal to try to examine social issues of the ways that we try to look at social questions in ways that we try to perform social issues, and so to the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to come here and do a TEDTalk over the brands and I wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you may have heard this ear, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some Facebook messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of my <unk>
What had been the following: I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have an idea of what it is and according to the <unk> and on the face, especially if you put it in <unk> you or your company do it.
But I said this is a very good chance to make it up.
You know how much people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew that somebody was going to buy the <unk>
If you had asked me a year ago a year ago, I had not been able to get him for a certainty.
But in the new film that I am working in the new film that I'm working on the marketing, we looked at the <unk> world.
And as I said earlier, I've been in awful situations in the last few years, but nothing I could see in horrible situations in the last few years, or so dangerous to the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about <unk> products, the marketing and advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and <unk>
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> is that everything from up at the bottom, at the end, it has <unk> <unk> all the time; all the time; all the time; all the time; all the time marks the title <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film -- it explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  It was more by <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure <unk> all the categories that we can be in the film.
You may have a shoe -- and it becomes the most cool shoe of <unk>
The most cool car that you have driven in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> the best drink that you've ever driven by the best <unk> than you've ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is so much to show the brands as a part of life, and make it <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- and make it <unk> the <unk> MS: And actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> <unk> is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea of the whole film to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time that I hear that is the greatest respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how they're going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them but that definitely is going to be a hard time to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> <unk> knows, you know, maybe for the moment when we go to the film, let's see it as a bunch of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most answers will be <unk>
MS: But will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be me?
JK: Two things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I was <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> when you look at the people that you have to be <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation.
<unk> the camera means "I don't want to know anything about your <unk>
