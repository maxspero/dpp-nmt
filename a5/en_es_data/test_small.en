You know, what I do is write for children,  and I'm probably America's  most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people  that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,  and no one has ever chose farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you  about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany  is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
You've just got to go around the block  to see it as an epiphany.
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.
It's the kind of complicated circle  that I'm going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the '60s  in high school in Stow, Ohio  where I was the class queer.
I was the guy beaten up bloody  every week in the boys' room,  until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom  in the teachers' lounge.
She did it in secret.
She did it for three years.
And I had to get out of town.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,  and I ended up in San Francisco, California --  met a lover --  and back in the '80s, found it necessary  to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago,  I got a phone call in the middle of the night  from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,  who said, "I need to see you.
I'm disappointed  that we never got to know each other as adults.
Could you please come to Ohio,  and please bring that man  that I know you have found by now.
And I should mention  that I have pancreatic cancer,  and I'd like you to please  be quick about this."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,  and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
We found her one, we got her there,  and we took care of her  and watched over her family,  because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult  got to know me,  she turned into a box of ashes  and was placed in my hands.
And what had happened  was the circle had closed,  it had become a circle --  and that epiphany I talked about  presented itself.
The epiphany is  that death is a part of life.
She saved my life;  I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything  that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty,  and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs --  it needs dignity,  love and pleasure,  and it's our job to hand those things out.
Thank you.
As an artist,  connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate  that humans are not separate from nature  and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,  where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,  trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me  were almost 200 feet out of the water,  and I could only help but wonder  that this was one snowflake  on top of another snowflake,  year after year.
Icebergs are born  when they calve off of glaciers  or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way  of interacting with their environment  and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up  and hold on to the bitter end,  while others can't take it anymore  and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,  that they're isolated,  that they're separate and alone,  much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts,  I am breathing in  its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts,  it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water  that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs  as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,  knowing that in these individual moments  they exist in that way  and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt;  it is not an end,  but a continuation  of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --  a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice  is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you  are of an iceberg that I photographed  in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion  that you get to actually witness  an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention  to the shape of the iceberg  and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll,  and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water,  or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
And just like that,  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples  in the middle of 1979  on the exact same day, at the exact same moment,  each conceiving a baby -- okay?
So two couples each conceiving one baby.
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception,  you're not going to listen to me.
So just imagine that for a moment.
And in this scenario,  I want to imagine that, in one case,  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,  meeting that X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case,  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,  meeting the X chromosome of the egg.
Both are viable; both take off.
We'll come back to these people later.
So I wear two hats  in most of what I do.
As the one hat,  I do history of anatomy.
I'm a historian by training,  and what I study in that case  is the way that people have dealt with anatomy --  meaning human bodies, animal bodies --  how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;  how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work  is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors.
In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms.
So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body.
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical.
And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types.
And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.
I'll just give you a few examples  of the types of ways you can have sex  that isn't standard for male or female.
So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes.
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.
But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone.
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.
And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here.
And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not.
Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
They're in the back of our body.
And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone.
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
The consequence is that somebody like me  has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  are in the middle of all the sex spectrum --  in some ways, they can be all over the place.
Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.
Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex.
Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.
The reason  that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health.
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories.
Or system has been based typically on the idea  that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history.
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations.
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism.
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  "Which is the test they're going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?"
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know  that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature.
So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  to stable identity categories  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
And it's not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed.
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
We look, for example, about the fact  that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA  with chimpanzees.
What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?
And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic.
So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example,  in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations  about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,  such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
We have very difficult conversations nowadays --  probably not out in the open as much as within medicine --  about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much  with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,  and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.
But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings.
And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
Understanding that these categories  are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
And it makes me tense  from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that tension,  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,  but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and so bold  and so radical in what they did  that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years,  and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
It's because of what happened in 1776  with the Founding Fathers.
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,  the original anatomical activists,  and this is why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept  and replaced it with another one  that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
So as you all recall,  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,  and the monarchy was basically based  on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world  didn't have a concept of DNA,  but they did have a concept of birthright.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power  should be in political power  because of the blood being passed down  from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,  and that concept  was all men are created equal.
They leveled that playing field  and decided the anatomy that mattered  was the commonality of anatomy,  not the difference in anatomy,  and that was a really radical thing to do.
Now they were doing it in part  because they were part of an Enlightenment system  where two things were growing up together.
And that was democracy growing up,  but it was also science growing up at the same time.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,  a lot of them were very interested in science,  and they were interested in a concept  of a naturalistic world.
They were moving away from supernatural explanations,  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,  where it transmitted  because of a very vague concept of birthright.
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,  they talk about nature and nature's God.
They don't talk about God and God's nature.
They're talking about the power of nature  to tell us who we are.
So as part of that,  they were coming to us with a concept  that was about anatomical commonality.
And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way  the Civil Rights movement of the future.
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
So what happened years afterward?
And women successfully argued that.
Next came the successful Civil Rights movement,  where we found people like Sojourner Truth  talking about, "Ain't I a woman?"
We find men  on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement  saying, "I am a man."
Again, people of color  appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,  again, successfully.
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
The problem is, of course,  that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,  we have to begin to question  why we maintain certain divisions.
Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,  anatomically, in our culture.
For example, I don't want  to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
I don't want to say five-year-olds  should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.
So there are some anatomical divisions  that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are  and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.
So let's go back to those two beings  conceived at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conceived  in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary,  is born three months prematurely,  so she's born on June 1, 1980.
Henry, by contrast, is born at term,  so he's born on March 1, 1980.
Simply by virtue of the fact  that Mary was born prematurely three months,  she comes into all sorts of rights  three months earlier than Henry does --  the right to consent to sex,  the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that,  not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,  except in terms of when he was born.
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --  although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --  by virtue of being assumed to be male  is now liable to be drafted,  which Mary does not need to worry about.
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states  have the same right that Henry has in all the states,  namely, the right to marry.
Henry can marry in every state a woman,  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.
So we have these anatomical categories that persist  that are in many ways problematic and questionable.
And the question to me becomes:  What do we do,  as our science gets to be so good  in looking at anatomy,  that we reach the point where we have to admit  that a democracy that's been based on anatomy  might start falling apart?
I don't want to give up the science,  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes  like the science is coming out from under us.
So where do we go?
It seems like what happens in our culture  is a sort of pragmatic attitude:  "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere,  so we will draw the line somewhere."
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
So for example,  Texas has at one point decided  that what it means to marry a man  is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.
Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.
But this is also very bizarre,  because of the story I told you at the beginning  about androgen insensitivity syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy,  Dr. Martin Luther King,  he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin,  but on the content of their character,"  moving beyond anatomy.
