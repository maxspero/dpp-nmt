You know, what I do is write for children,  and I'm probably America's  most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people  that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,  and no one has ever chose farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you  about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany  is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
You've just got to go around the block  to see it as an epiphany.
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.
It's the kind of complicated circle  that I'm going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the '60s  in high school in Stow, Ohio  where I was the class queer.
I was the guy beaten up bloody  every week in the boys' room,  until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom  in the teachers' lounge.
She did it in secret.
She did it for three years.
And I had to get out of town.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,  and I ended up in San Francisco, California --  met a lover --  and back in the '80s, found it necessary  to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago,  I got a phone call in the middle of the night  from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,  who said, "I need to see you.
I'm disappointed  that we never got to know each other as adults.
Could you please come to Ohio,  and please bring that man  that I know you have found by now.
And I should mention  that I have pancreatic cancer,  and I'd like you to please  be quick about this."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,  and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
We found her one, we got her there,  and we took care of her  and watched over her family,  because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult  got to know me,  she turned into a box of ashes  and was placed in my hands.
And what had happened  was the circle had closed,  it had become a circle --  and that epiphany I talked about  presented itself.
The epiphany is  that death is a part of life.
She saved my life;  I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything  that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty,  and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs --  it needs dignity,  love and pleasure,  and it's our job to hand those things out.
Thank you.
As an artist,  connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate  that humans are not separate from nature  and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,  where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,  trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me  were almost 200 feet out of the water,  and I could only help but wonder  that this was one snowflake  on top of another snowflake,  year after year.
Icebergs are born  when they calve off of glaciers  or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way  of interacting with their environment  and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up  and hold on to the bitter end,  while others can't take it anymore  and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,  that they're isolated,  that they're separate and alone,  much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts,  I am breathing in  its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts,  it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water  that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs  as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,  knowing that in these individual moments  they exist in that way  and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt;  it is not an end,  but a continuation  of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --  a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice  is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you  are of an iceberg that I photographed  in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion  that you get to actually witness  an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention  to the shape of the iceberg  and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll,  and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water,  or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
And just like that,  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples  in the middle of 1979  on the exact same day, at the exact same moment,  each conceiving a baby -- okay?
So two couples each conceiving one baby.
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception,  you're not going to listen to me.
So just imagine that for a moment.
And in this scenario,  I want to imagine that, in one case,  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,  meeting that X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case,  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,  meeting the X chromosome of the egg.
Both are viable; both take off.
We'll come back to these people later.
So I wear two hats  in most of what I do.
As the one hat,  I do history of anatomy.
I'm a historian by training,  and what I study in that case  is the way that people have dealt with anatomy --  meaning human bodies, animal bodies --  how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;  how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work  is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors.
In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms.
So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body.
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical.
And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types.
And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.
I'll just give you a few examples  of the types of ways you can have sex  that isn't standard for male or female.
So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes.
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.
But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone.
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.
And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here.
And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not.
Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
They're in the back of our body.
And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone.
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
The consequence is that somebody like me  has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  are in the middle of all the sex spectrum --  in some ways, they can be all over the place.
Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.
Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex.
Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.
The reason  that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health.
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories.
Or system has been based typically on the idea  that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history.
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations.
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism.
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  "Which is the test they're going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?"
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know  that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature.
So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  to stable identity categories  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
And it's not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed.
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
We look, for example, about the fact  that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA  with chimpanzees.
What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?
And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic.
So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example,  in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations  about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,  such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
We have very difficult conversations nowadays --  probably not out in the open as much as within medicine --  about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much  with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,  and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.
But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings.
And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
Understanding that these categories  are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
And it makes me tense  from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that tension,  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,  but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and so bold  and so radical in what they did  that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years,  and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
It's because of what happened in 1776  with the Founding Fathers.
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,  the original anatomical activists,  and this is why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept  and replaced it with another one  that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
So as you all recall,  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,  and the monarchy was basically based  on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world  didn't have a concept of DNA,  but they did have a concept of birthright.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power  should be in political power  because of the blood being passed down  from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,  and that concept  was all men are created equal.
They leveled that playing field  and decided the anatomy that mattered  was the commonality of anatomy,  not the difference in anatomy,  and that was a really radical thing to do.
Now they were doing it in part  because they were part of an Enlightenment system  where two things were growing up together.
And that was democracy growing up,  but it was also science growing up at the same time.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,  a lot of them were very interested in science,  and they were interested in a concept  of a naturalistic world.
They were moving away from supernatural explanations,  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,  where it transmitted  because of a very vague concept of birthright.
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,  they talk about nature and nature's God.
They don't talk about God and God's nature.
They're talking about the power of nature  to tell us who we are.
So as part of that,  they were coming to us with a concept  that was about anatomical commonality.
And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way  the Civil Rights movement of the future.
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
So what happened years afterward?
And women successfully argued that.
Next came the successful Civil Rights movement,  where we found people like Sojourner Truth  talking about, "Ain't I a woman?"
We find men  on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement  saying, "I am a man."
Again, people of color  appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,  again, successfully.
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
The problem is, of course,  that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,  we have to begin to question  why we maintain certain divisions.
Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,  anatomically, in our culture.
For example, I don't want  to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
I don't want to say five-year-olds  should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.
So there are some anatomical divisions  that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are  and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.
So let's go back to those two beings  conceived at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conceived  in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary,  is born three months prematurely,  so she's born on June 1, 1980.
Henry, by contrast, is born at term,  so he's born on March 1, 1980.
Simply by virtue of the fact  that Mary was born prematurely three months,  she comes into all sorts of rights  three months earlier than Henry does --  the right to consent to sex,  the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that,  not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,  except in terms of when he was born.
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --  although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --  by virtue of being assumed to be male  is now liable to be drafted,  which Mary does not need to worry about.
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states  have the same right that Henry has in all the states,  namely, the right to marry.
Henry can marry in every state a woman,  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.
So we have these anatomical categories that persist  that are in many ways problematic and questionable.
And the question to me becomes:  What do we do,  as our science gets to be so good  in looking at anatomy,  that we reach the point where we have to admit  that a democracy that's been based on anatomy  might start falling apart?
I don't want to give up the science,  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes  like the science is coming out from under us.
So where do we go?
It seems like what happens in our culture  is a sort of pragmatic attitude:  "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere,  so we will draw the line somewhere."
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
So for example,  Texas has at one point decided  that what it means to marry a man  is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.
Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.
But this is also very bizarre,  because of the story I told you at the beginning  about androgen insensitivity syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy,  Dr. Martin Luther King,  he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin,  but on the content of their character,"  moving beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of character?
I also want to point out  that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,  because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know  that are probably more deserving of social services  than some humans I know.
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know  that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions  about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.
So how do we operationalize  the question of content of character?
It turns out to be really difficult.
And part of me also wonders,  what if content of character  turns out to be something that's scannable in the future --  able to be seen with an fMRI?
Do we really want to go there?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be really important  to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead  of thinking about this issue of democracy.
We've done a really good job struggling with democracy,  and I think we would do a good job in the future.
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men  is liable to be murdered,  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change,  in which case he's allowed to live.
We don't have that kind of situation.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with --  a surgeon I talked to a few years ago  who had brought over a set of conjoined twins  in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
But when I was on the phone with him,  asking why he was going to do this surgery --  this was a very high-risk surgery --  his answer was that, in this other nation,  these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.
My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum  instead of a separation surgery?"
The United States has offered tremendous possibility  for allowing people to be the way they are,  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be in the lead.
Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you  that I've been talking a lot about the fathers.
And I want to think about the possibilities  of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,  if we had more involved the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,  and that is that I think that there may be  different kinds of insights  that can come from different kinds of anatomies,  particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex,  I've also been interested in sex difference research.
And one of the things that I've been really interested in  is looking at the differences between males and females  in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies  is that females, on average --  not everyone, but on average --  are more inclined to be very attentive  to complex social relations  and to taking care of people  who are basically vulnerable within the group.
And so if we think about that,  we have an interesting situation on our hands.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school,  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism --  I considered myself a feminist, as I still do --  asked a really strange question.
He said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism."
And I thought, "Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,  so there's nothing feminine about feminism."
But the more I thought about his question,  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.
That is to say, there might be something, on average,  different about female brains from male brains  that makes us more attentive  to deeply complex social relationships  and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.
So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive  to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,  it's possible that if we injected more mothers  into this concept,  what we would have is more of a concept  of, not just how to protect,  but how to care for each other.
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future,  when we take democracy beyond anatomy,  is to think less about the individual body,  in terms of the identity,  and think more about those relationships.
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,  we're thinking about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007,  I decided that we needed to reconceptualize  how we thought about economic development.
Our new goal should be  that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,  they should be able to choose between  at least a handful  of different cities  that were all competing to attract new residents.
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.
There are billions of people in developing countries  who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.
But the amazing thing about cities  is they're worth so much more  than it costs to build them.
So we could easily supply the world  with dozens, maybe hundreds,  of new cities.
Now this might sound preposterous to you  if you've never thought about new cities.
But just substitute apartment building for cities.
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;  the other half aren't there yet.
You could try and expand the capacity  by doing additions on all the existing apartments.
But you know what you'd run into  is those apartments and the surrounding areas  have rules to avoid discomfort  and the distractions of construction.
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.
But you could go out someplace brand new,  build a brand new apartment building,  as long as the rules there  were ones that facilitated construction  rather than getting in the way.
So I proposed  that governments create new reform zones  big enough to hold cities  and gave them a name: charter cities.
Later I learned that at about this same time,  Javier and Octavio  were thinking about the challenge of reform  in Honduras.
They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year  would leave to go to the United States,  and they wanted to ask, what could they do  to make sure that those people could stay  and do the same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009,  Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.
At the next regularly scheduled election,  Pepe Lobo won in a landslide  on a platform that promised reform,  but reconciliation as well.
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.
Meanwhile, I was getting ready  to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of refinement,  trial and error, a lot of user testing,  I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city  down to the bare essentials.
The first point was the importance of rules,  like those rules that say  you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,  but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,  and it's usually the rules that hold us back.
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala  sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.
He showed it to Javier.
They called me.
They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami,  in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point  about how valuable cities are,  how much more valuable they are than they cost.
And I used this slide  showing how valuable the raw land is  in a place like New York City:  notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,  per square meter.
But it was a fairly abstract discussion,  and at some point when there was a pause,  Octavio said,  "Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,  a charter city is a place  where you start with uninhabited land,  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there  and then a chance for people to opt in,  to go live under those rules or not.
So I was asked by the president of Honduras  who said that we need to do this project,  this is important,  this could be the way forward for our country.
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa  and talk again on January fourth and fifth.
So I presented  another fact-filled lecture  that included a slide like this,  which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,  it has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver,  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.
This airport alone  covers more than 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,  if you build a new city,  you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.
Everybody applauded politely.
The faces in the audience  were very serious and attentive.
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,  "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.
I've got it here on my laptop."
So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.
And it got to the essence,  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to  which could be in Honduras,  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.
And it also involved new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras  would need help from partner countries,  who could benefit from partner countries  who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,  so everybody can trust  that the charter really will be enforced.
We went and looked at a site.
This picture's from there.
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution  to have a constitutional provision  that allows for special development regions.
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment  was 124 to one.
All parties, all factions in society, backed this.
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.
On February 17th they passed it again  with another vote of 114 to one.
Immediately after that vote,  on February 21st to the 24th,  a delegation of about 30 Hondurans  went to the two places in the world  that are most interested in getting into the city building business.
One is South Korea.
This is a picture of a big, new city center  that's being built in South Korea --  bigger than downtown Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years,  after they spent four years getting the permits.
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.
They've actually built two cities already in China  and are preparing the third.
So if you think about this practically,  here's where we are.
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.
They're putting in place a legal system  that could allow for managers to come in,  and also an external legal system.
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court  be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.
There's designers and builders of cities  who are very interested.
They even can bring with them some financing.
But the one thing you know they've already solved  is that there's lots of tenants.
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,  especially in a place with a free trade zone,  and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.
Around the world, there's 700 million people  who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.
There's a million a year  who leave Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of these are a father  who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --  sometimes a single mother  who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.
Sadly, sometimes there are even children  who are trying to get reunited with their parents  that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.
So what kind of an idea is it  to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?
Or to build a dozen of these,  or a hundred of these, around the world?
What kind of an idea is it  to think about insisting  that every family have a choice of several cities  that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends from Honduras  asked me to say thank you, TED.
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.
But before I show you what I've got inside,  I'm going to make a very public confession,  and that is,  I'm outfit-obsessed.
I love finding, wearing,  and more recently,  photographing and blogging  a different, colorful, crazy outfit  for every single occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
I get all my clothes secondhand  from flea markets and thrift stores.
Aww, thank you.
Secondhand shopping  allows me to reduce the impact  my wardrobe has on the environment  and on my wallet.
I get to meet all kinds of great people;  my dollars usually go to a good cause;  I look pretty unique;  and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be my size?
Will I like the color?
Will it be under $20?
If all the answers are yes,  I feel as though I've won.
I want to get back to my suitcase  and tell you what I packed  for this exciting week here at TED.
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I brought seven pairs of underpants  and that's it.
Exactly one week's worth of undies  is all I put in my suitcase.
I was betting that I'd be able to find  everything else I could possible want to wear  once I got here to Palm Springs.
And since you don't know me  as the woman walking around TED in her underwear --    that means I found a few things.
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.
Does that sound good?
So as I do this,  I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons  that, believe it or not, I have picked up  in these adventures wearing nothing new.
So let's start with Sunday.
I call this "Shiny Tiger."
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
This whole outfit, including the jacket,  cost me $55,  and it was the most expensive thing  that I wore the entire week.
Monday: Color is powerful.
It is almost physiologically impossible  to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.
If you are happy,  you are going to attract other happy people to you.
Tuesday:  Fitting in is way overrated.
I've spent a whole lot of my life  trying to be myself  and at the same time fit in.
Just be who you are.
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people,  they will not only get it,  they will appreciate it.
Wednesday:  Embrace your inner child.
Sometimes people tell me  that I look like I'm playing dress-up,  or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.
I like to smile  and say, "Thank you."
Thursday:  Confidence is key.
If you think you look good in something,  you almost certainly do.
And if you don't think you look good in something,  you're also probably right.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
But it wasn't until I turned 30  that I really got what this meant.
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
If you believe you're a beautiful person  inside and out,  there is no look that you can't pull off.
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you:  Gold sequins go with everything.
And finally, Saturday:  Developing your own unique personal style  is a really great way to tell the world something about you  without having to say a word.
It's been proven to me time and time again  as people have walked up to me this week  simply because of what I'm wearing,  and we've had great conversations.
So obviously this is not all going to fit  back in my tiny suitcase.
So before I go home to Brooklyn,  I'm going to donate everything back.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week  is that it's okay to let go.
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things  because around the corner,  there is always going to be  another crazy, colorful,  shiny outfit  just waiting for me,  if I put a little love in my heart and look.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain,  and your brain can be broken into two parts.
There's the left half, which is the logical side,  and then the right half,  which is the intuitive.
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,  then we can plot our brain.
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.
So where would you put your brain on this scale?
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,  but I think for most people in the audience,  your brain is something like this --  with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.
You can be logical and intuitive.
And so I consider myself one of these people,  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,  who need a good deal of logic  to string together these complex ideas.
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition  to actually make the experiments work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,  and then we develop our intuition from there.
And really you do the same thing.
So some intuition  that you may have developed over the years  is that one thing is only in one place at a time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think about  one thing being in two different places at the same time,  but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.
He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,  and that they stay in one place.
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,  unless you're a particle physicist.
It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,  because they don't play with car stops,  they play with these little weird particles.
And when they play with their particles,  they find they do all sorts of really weird things --  like they can fly right through walls,  or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And so they wrote down all these observations,  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;  you needed quantum mechanics  to describe little, tiny particles.
But you didn't need it  to describe the large, everyday objects around us.
This didn't really sit well with my intuition,  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.
Well, I play with them sometimes,  but not very often.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.
Because if everything is made up of little particles  and all the little particles  follow quantum mechanics,  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing  if we could somehow show  that an everyday object  also follows quantum mechanics.
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.
So I made one.
This is the first object  that you can see  that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.
So what we're looking at here  is a tiny computer chip.
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
This is a photograph of the object.
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,  and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.
And so I made this thing  in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --  to make this swimming pool-shaped hole  underneath the device.
This device has the ability  to be in a quantum superposition,  but it needs a little help to do it.
Here, let me give you an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,  but then other people get on board  and I stop doing those things  because I don't want to bother them,  or, frankly, scare them.
So quantum mechanics says  that inanimate objects feel the same way.
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects  are not just people,  but it's also the light shining on it  and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.
And so we knew, if we wanted to see  this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.
And so that's what we did.
We turned off the lights,  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,  and then we cooled it down  to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.
Now, all alone in the elevator,  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
And so we measured its motion.
We found it was moving in really weird ways.
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --  like expanding and contracting bellows.
And by giving it a gentle nudge,  we were able to make it both vibrate  and not vibrate  at the same time --  something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.
What does it mean for one thing  to be both vibrating and not vibrating  at the same time?
So let's think about the atoms.
So in one case:  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal  are sitting still  and at the same time those same atoms  are moving up and down.
Now it's only at precise times when they align.
The rest of the time they're delocalized.
That means that every atom  is in two different places at the same time,  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal  is in two different places.
I think this is really cool.
Really.
It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years  because, check this out,  the difference in scale  between a single atom and that chunk of metal  is about the same as the difference  between that chunk of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,  that chunk of metal can be in two different places,  then why not you?
I mean, this is just my logical side talking.
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,  what would that be like?
How would your consciousness  handle your body being delocalized in space?
There's one more part to the story.
It's when we warmed it up,  and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,  we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.
And so I had to develop this new intuition,  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator  are really just quantum objects  just crammed into a tiny space.
You hear a lot of talk  about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.
Well, that's not quite right.
It's more than that; it's deeper.
It's that those connections,  your connections to all the things around you,  literally define who you are,  and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amit.
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,  and I pitched this idea  of doing something with museums and art  to my boss who's actually here,  and she allowed me to do it.
And it took 18 months.
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,  with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,  and it's access.
And I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I'm not complaining --  but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums,  I started learning a lot.
And while working at Google,  I tried to put this desire  to make it more accessible with technology together.
So we formed a team, a great team of people,  and we started doing this.
I'm going to probably get into the demo  and then tell you a couple of the interesting things  we've had since launch.
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
You look around at all these museums here.
You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,  the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,  the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
Two ways of going in -- very simple.
Click and, bang, you're in this museum.
It doesn't matter where you are --  Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
You move around, you have fun.
You want to navigate around the museum?
Open the plan up,  and, in one click, jump.
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.
Keep going. Have fun.
Explore.
Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.
So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,  "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.
I see this plus sign.
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.
Now this is one of the images.
So this is all of the meta-data information.
For those of you who are truly interested in art,  you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now.
And this is one of these images that we captured  in what we call gigapixel technology.
So this image, for example,  has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.
And I get a lot of people asking me:  "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.
You can zoom around very simply.
You see some fun stuff happening here.
I love this guy; his expression is priceless.
But then you really want to go deep.
And so I started playing around,  and I found something going on over here.
And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting."
Went in, and I started noticing  that these kids were actually beating something.
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,  and actually found out that this is a game  called squall,  which involves beating a goose with a stick  on Shrove Tuesday.
And apparently it was quite popular.
I don't know why they did it,  but I learned something about it.
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.
Now just to give you some perspective,  I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.
Here is where we were,  and this is the painting.
The best is yet to come -- so in a second.
So now let's just quickly  jump into the MoMA, again in New York.
So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night."
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.
But what if you want to see brush strokes?
And what if you want to see  how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
You zoom in. You really go in.
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,  and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "The Starry Night,"  I think, never seen like this before.
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.
Any one of you, anybody --  doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,  if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter.
You can go and create your own museum online --  create your own collection across all these images.
Very simply, you go in --  and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom --  you can just zoom around.
This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends  and really get a conversation going  about what you're feeling  when you go through these masterpieces.
So I think, in conclusion,  for me, the main thing  is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.
I probably shouldn't say that.
It really comes from these artists.
And that's been my humbling experience in this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium  that we do justice to their artwork  and represent it properly online.
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays  is, "Did you do this  to replicate the experience of going to a museum?"
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I've got something to show you.
Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.
Let me tell you a bit about it.
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,  and every boy in Italy grows up  with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --  but the reason I'm showing you this  is that something very interesting  happened in Formula 1 racing  over the past couple of decades.
Now some time ago,  if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,  you take a budget, and you bet your budget  on a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.
This is what, in engineering terms,  you would call a real time control system.
And basically, it's a system made of two components --  a sensing and an actuating component.
What is interesting today  is that real time control systems  are starting to enter into our lives.
Our cities, over the past few years,  just have been blanketed  with networks, electronics.
They're becoming like computers in open air.
And, as computers in open air,  they're starting to respond in a different way  to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,  cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,  but they are 50 percent of the world's population.
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --  up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.
Beyond cities,  all of this sensing and actuating  is entering our everyday objects.
That's from an exhibition that  Paola Antonelli is organizing  at MoMA later this year, during the summer.
It's called "Talk to Me."
Well our objects, our environment  is starting to talk back to us.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there  were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans  with the environment out there.
In a certain sense,  it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,  at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --  actually you can still see a small chip underneath --  and said, shouted,  "Perch non parli? Why don't you talk?"
Well today, for the first time,  our environment is starting to talk back to us.
And I'll show just a few examples --  again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.
Let's starting with sensing.
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you  is actually one of the first projects by our lab.
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,  and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.
And anyway, Italy won at the end.
Now look at what happened that day  just by monitoring activity  happening on the network.
Here you see the city.
You see the Colosseum in the middle,  the river Tiber.
It's morning, before the match.
You see the timeline on the top.
Early afternoon,  people here and there,  making calls and moving.
The match begins -- silence.
France scores. Italy scores.
Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second half. End of normal time.
First overtime, second.
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.
Italy wins. Yeah.
Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.
You saw the big peak.
The following day, again everybody went to the center  to meet the winning team  and the prime minister at the time.
And then everybody moved down.
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,  where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,  to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today  in a way that we couldn't have done  just a few years ago.
Another quick example about sensing:  it's not about people,  but about things we use and consume.
Well today, we know everything  about where our objects come from.
This is a map that shows you  all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project,  we actually developed some small tags  to track trash as it moves through the system.
So we actually started with a number of volunteers  who helped us in Seattle,  just over a year ago,  to tag what they were throwing away --  different types of things, as you can see here --  things they would throw away anyway.
Then we put a little chip, little tag,  onto the trash  and then started following it.
Here are the results we just obtained.
From Seattle ...
after one week.
With this information we realized  there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
This data was not available before.
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
But the other thing is that we believe  that if we see every day  that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,  it's still somewhere on the planet.
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.
And if we show that to people,  then we can also promote some behavioral change.
So that was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,  he could tell you much more about sensing  and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,  but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,  and that's actuating our environment.
And the first project  is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
It started with a question by the mayor of the city,  who came to us saying  that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition  of using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was: How could technology, new technology,  be added to that?
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop  was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,  solenoid valves, taps,  opening and closing.
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.
If those pixels fall,  you can write on it,  you can show patterns, images, text.
And even you can approach it, and it will open up  to let you jump through,  as you see in this image.
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.
He liked it very much.
And we got a commission to design a building  at the entrance of the expo.
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.
The whole building is made of water.
There's no doors or windows,  but when you approach it,  it will open up to let you in.
The roof also is covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind,  if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.
Or you could close the building,  and the whole architecture will disappear,  like in this case.
You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,  when they take the roof down,  of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,  the architecture almost disappears.
Here's the building working.
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.
And here was myself trying not to get wet,  testing the sensors that open the water.
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night  when all of the sensors stopped working.
But actually that night, it was even more fun.
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,  because the way of engaging with the building became something different.
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,  but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,  and you had to jump without getting wet.
(Crowd Noise)  And that was, for us, was very interesting,  because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,  we always think about how people will use the things we design.
But then reality's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things  that are used and interact with people.
Here is an image then of the building  with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,  and then projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about  the following project I'll show you now.
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.
Imagine you could have small helicopters  that move in the air,  and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --  almost as a cloud that can move in space.
Here is the video.
So imagine one helicopter,  like the one we saw before,  moving with others,  in synchrony.
So you can have this cloud.
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --  a regular configuration in two dimensions.
Or in regular, but in three dimensions,  where the thing that changes is the light,  not the pixels' position.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine your screen could just appear  in different scales or sizes,  different types of resolution.
But then the whole thing can be  just a 3D cloud of pixels  that you can approach and move through it  and see from many, many directions.
Here is the real Flyfire  control and going down to form the regular grid as before.
When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.
You can have each pixel  having an input that comes from people,  from people's movement, or so and so.
I want to show you something here for the first time.
We've been working with Roberto Bolle,  one of today's top ballet dancers --  the toile at Metropolitan in New York  and La Scala in Milan --  and actually captured his movement in 3D  in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
And here you can see Roberto dancing.
You see on the left the pixels,  the different resolutions being captured.
It's both 3D scanning in real time  and motion capture.
So you can reconstruct a whole movement.
You can go all the way through.
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them  and play with color and movement  and gravity and rotation.
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs  for Flyfire.
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.
It's called The Cloud.
And the idea here is, imagine, again,  we can involve people  in doing something and changing our environment --  almost to impart what we call cloud raising --  like barn raising, but with a cloud.
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.
And I think what is remarkable  that has happened over the past couple of years  is that, over the past couple of decades,  we went from the physical world to the digital one.
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,  and making that accessible through the Internet.
Now today, for the first time --  and the Obama campaign showed us this --  we can go from the digital world,  from the self-organizing power of networks,  to the physical one.
This can be, in our case,  we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be,  in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --  think about climate change or CO2 emissions --  how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.
So the idea that we can actually involve people  in doing this thing together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,  in the same way as the real cloud  is a cloud made of particles.
And those particles are water,  where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.
You can actually see from underneath,  sharing the main moments  for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,  and really using it as a way to connect with the community.
So both the physical cloud in the sky  and something you can go to the top [of],  like London's new mountaintop.
You can enter inside it.
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --  but most importantly,  a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.
Thank you.
How would you like to be better than you are?
Suppose I said  that, with just a few changes in your genes,  you could get a better memory --  more precise,  more accurate and quicker.
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,  with more stamina.
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?
How about living longer with good health?
Or perhaps you're one of those  who's always yearned for more creativity.
Which one would you like the most?
Which would you like, if you could have just one?
(Audience Member: Creativity.)  Creativity.
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hands. Let me see.
A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.
That's very good.
How many would opt for memory?
Quite a few more.
How about fitness?
A few less.
What about longevity?
Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have any one of these,  it would be a very different world.
Is it just imaginary?
Or, is it, perhaps, possible?
Evolution has been a perennial topic  here at the TED Conference,  but I want to give you today  one doctor's take on the subject.
The great 20th-century geneticist,  T.G. Dobzhansky,  who was also a communicant  in the Russian Orthodox Church,  once wrote an essay that he titled  "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense  Except in the Light of Evolution."
But if you do accept  biological evolution,  consider this:  is it just about the past,  or is it about the future?
Does it apply to others,  or does it apply to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch,  way out on one end,  is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.
We branch off of a common ancestor  to modern chimpanzees  about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval,  there have been perhaps 20 or 25  different species of hominids.
Some have come and gone.
We have been here for about 130,000 years.
It may seem like we're quite remote  from other parts of this tree of life,  but actually, for the most part,  the basic machinery of our cells  is pretty much the same.
Do you realize that we can take advantage  and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium  to produce the protein of human insulin  used to treat diabetics?
This is not like human insulin;  this is the same protein  that is chemically indistinguishable  from what comes out of your pancreas.
And speaking of bacteria,  do you realize that each of us carries in our gut  more bacteria  than there are cells in the rest of our body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean think of it,  when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,  do you think about the bacteria?
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment  for those bacteria.
It's warm, it's dark, it's moist,  it's very cozy.
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want  with no effort on their part.
It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,  with the occasional interruption  of the unintended forced rush to the exit.
But otherwise,  you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,  just as they are essential to your life.
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,  and they protect you against certain diseases.
But what will come in the future?
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise  as a species?
Or, are we destined  to become something different --  something, perhaps, even better adapted  to the environment?
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,  life on Earth is like a brief measure;  the animal kingdom,  like a single measure;  and human life,  a small grace note.
That was us.
That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,  so I hope you enjoyed it.
Now when I was a freshman in college,  I took my first biology class.
I was fascinated  by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I became enamored of the power of evolution,  and I realized something very fundamental:  in most of the existence of life  in single-celled organisms,  each cell simply divides,  and all of the genetic energy of that cell  is carried on in both daughter cells.
But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,  things start to change.
Sexual reproduction enters the picture.
And very importantly,  with the introduction of sexual reproduction  that passes on the genome,  the rest of the body  becomes expendable.
In fact, you could say  that the inevitability of the death of our bodies  enters in evolutionary time  at the same moment  as sexual reproduction.
Now I have to confess,  when I was a college undergraduate,  I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex --  it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,  but with each passing year,  I've come to have increasing doubts.
I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,  who was performing still in Las Vegas  well into his 90s.
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.
He answers the door.
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
She looks at him and says,  "I'm here for super sex."
"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup."
I came to realize,  as a physician,  that I was working toward a goal  which was different from the goal of evolution --  not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to keep us healthy.
I wanted to restore health from disease.
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.
Evolution is all about passing on the genome  to the next generation,  adapting and surviving  through generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view,  you and I are like the booster rockets  designed to send the genetic payload  into the next level of orbit  and then drop off into the sea.
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed  when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to achieve it through not dying."
Evolution does not necessarily  favor the longest-lived.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest  or the strongest or the fastest,  and not even the smartest.
Evolution favors  those creatures best adapted  to their environment.
That is the sole test  of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean,  bacteria that are thermophilic  and can survive at the steam vent heat  that would otherwise produce, if fish were there,  sous-vide cooked fish,  nevertheless, have managed  to make that a hospitable environment for them.
So what does this mean,  as we look back at what has happened in evolution,  and as we think about the place again  of humans in evolution,  and particularly as we look ahead  to the next phase,  I would say  that there are a number of possibilities.
The first is that we will not evolve.
We have reached  a kind of equipoise.
And the reasoning behind that would be,  first, we have, through medicine,  managed to preserve a lot of genes  that would otherwise be selected out  and be removed from the population.
And secondly, we as a species  have so configured our environment  that we have managed to make it adapt to us  as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we immigrate and circulate  and intermix so much  that you can't any longer  have the isolation that is necessary  for evolution to take place.
A second possibility  is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,  natural, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be  that the wheels of evolution grind slowly,  but they are inexorable.
And as far as isolation goes,  when we as a species  do colonize distant planets,  there will be the isolation and the environmental changes  that could produce evolution  in the natural way.
But there's a third possibility,  an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.
I call it neo-evolution --  the new evolution  that is not simply natural,  but guided and chosen  by us as individuals  in the choices that we will make.
Now how could this come about?
How could it be possible that we would do this?
Consider, first, the reality  that people today, in some cultures,  are making choices about their offspring.
They're, in some cultures,  choosing to have more males than females.
It's not necessarily good for the society,  but it's what the individual and the family are choosing.
Think also,  if it were possible ever  for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,  but for you in your body  to make the genetic adjustments  that would cure or prevent diseases.
What if you could make the genetic changes  to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's  or reduce the risk of cancer  or eliminate stroke?
Wouldn't you want  to make those changes  in your genes?
If we look ahead,  these kind of changes  are going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project  started in 1990,  and it took 13 years.
It cost 2.7 billion dollars.
The year after it was finished in 2004,  you could do the same job  for 20 million dollars in three to four months.
Today, you can have a complete sequence  of the three billion base pairs in the human genome  at a cost of about 20,000 dollars  and in the space of about a week.
It won't be very long  before the reality will be  the 1,000-dollar human genome,  and it will be increasingly available for everyone.
These changes are coming.
The same technology  that has produced the human insulin in bacteria  can make viruses  that will not only protect you against themselves,  but induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe it or not,  there's an experimental trial going on  with vaccine against influenza  that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?
These are all reality today,  and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.
Imagine then  just two other little changes.
You can change the cells in your body,  but what if you could change the cells in your offspring?
What if you could change the sperm and the ova,  or change the newly fertilized egg,  and give your offspring a better chance  at a healthier life --  eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,  reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier children?
And then, that same analytic technology,  that same engine of science  that can produce  the changes to prevent disease,  will also enable us  to adopt super-attributes,  hyper-capacities --  that better memory.
Why not have the quick wit  of a Ken Jennings,  especially if you can augment it  with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have the quick twitch muscle  that will enable you to run faster and longer?
Why not live longer?
These will be irresistible.
And when we are at a position  where we can pass it on to the next generation,  and we can adopt the attributes we want,  we will have converted  old-style evolution  into neo-evolution.
We'll take a process  that normally might require 100,000 years,  and we can compress it down to a thousand years --  and maybe even in the next 100 years.
These are choices  that your grandchildren,  or their grandchildren,  are going to have before them.
Will we use these choices  to make a society that is better,  that is more successful, that is kinder?
